Okay, one month down, one month left. I am starting to brain storm what to do with the remainder of my time here. I feel like the three weeks I have when the course ends is just enough time to begin but not finish something. The big question is do I work on producing something or do I volunteer and watch the production. I do feel the pressure to produce something, as usually when I go away I come back with pictures. This is a different set up though. And I am burnt out. My last semester at school was a real battering, despite a couple gems of professors.

I have thought about photographing the process of TV Roc, the cable station run out of Rocinha, the more developed favela in Zona Sul. We visited the station last week. The people there were energetic, very capable, and many spoke some English, which could help me out. When the class visited a crew interviewed many class members about their perceptions of the favela and their reasons for being here.

  Another thing that has been fascinating me the process of the Pan American games and the negative impact on various communities. I saw a newspaper article about how certain favelas near Copacabana beach and along the major high ways will be occupied by police during the games. Gay pride has also been rescheduled.

  In the mean time maybe I&#8217;ll occupy myself with photographing mushed cockroaches on the sidewalks of the cantinas at night or something artsy and passive. Today, we&#8217;re off to Ciudade de Deus.
