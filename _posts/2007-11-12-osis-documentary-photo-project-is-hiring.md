<img src="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/photography/focus_areas/mw/13/images/image_150x150" align="right" />[The Documentary Photography Project][1] at the Open Society Institute is looking for a full time program assistant. Through the Moving Walls exhibition series and distribution grants, the project makes a unique contribution to the field of documentary photography by encouraging highly skilled photographers to invest in long term projects aimed at affecting social change. If you are interested in arts administration, documentary photography, and social justice, this is the place to be. I have interned with the Documentary Photography Project for the past year, gaining invaluable tools for analyzing photographs&#8217; effectiveness for addressing social and economic issues, and knowledge of innovative distribution methods that break out of that standard exhibition and book molds. Now that one of the project coordinators, Whitney Johnson, has moved on to be head photo editor at The New Yorker, the Doc Photo Project needs an extra hand. Find more info on the position on the [I][2][dealist posting][2].
