You guessed itâ€”the radio silence here means I&#8217;ve been busy with projects that are either top secret or in their infancy. I can&#8217;t wait to share the work I&#8217;ve been doing building communities online and researching content for interactive projects. In the meantime, check out [this post on BagNews][1] about the wonderful fundraiser they threw last week, including a photo and video of me drawing the winning raffle tickets. I used to produce [Salons][2] for BagNews and will again in the near future.
