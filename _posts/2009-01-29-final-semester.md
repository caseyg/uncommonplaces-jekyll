Here&#8217;s my class line up:

**Thesis 2**

The second semester of thesis class; [Adam Chapman][1] is teaching my section. I&#8217;ll soon move into prototyping [Lilliput][2], testing out differing uses of the Wunderkammer and interactive storytelling to create a travel log.  Even though the conceptual framework is reinforced by all my studies in History, Photography, and Design and Technology, implementation in a interactive digital format is very new territory for me. This is a risky move for thesis.  That said, I am committed to serious experimentation with interactive narrative before I leave school.

**Narrative and Dynamic Systems**

Apparently, game design is dealing with many of the same issues of affect, narrative, agency and engagement that documentary photography and social art practices are grappling with. I will use this gaming centric class to support thesis work and mine emergent creative fields for insight into the roll of interactivity and agency in the current media landscape. [Nick Fortugno][3] teaches this class (love having teachers who have wikipedia articles about them). I&#8217;ll get to read [Thomas Pynchon][4] and [Mark Z. Danielewski][5] and join an [MUD][6] and play [RPG][7]s. Yea, Design and Technology!  I&#8217;m already fantasizing about shamless throwbacks to highschool geekdom.

**Intro to Databases: PHP and MySQL**

Server side technology and databases have a lot to do with the power behind web 2.0. I&#8217;ll be working learning the practical programming side of these technologies as instructed by Jamie Kosoy.  Practical skills!

**Origins of Contemporary Visual Culture**

This history class will trace modern attention economies and visuality from the 19th century up to&#8230; well, wherever we end up. I&#8217;ve been dealing with issues originating in 19th century practices of the archiving and indexicality, so it&#8217;s exciting to address this with some rigor in a classroom setting. Last semester, I studied the history of information theories and their relationship to technological development and body politics. This class will step back a little earlier to understand how life, machines, and governmentality came together in modernity.  [Orit Halpern][8] is teaching this class.
