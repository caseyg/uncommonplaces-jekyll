Last Friday was my final day interning at [Local Projects][1], a media design studio for museums and public spaces.

I sought out the internship to understand how my diverse background might be of use in a professional media design studio.  Local Projects turned out to be an exceptionally good match for my interest in history, documentary practice, and storytelling.  The studio impressed upon me the solid roll of content driven and contextually specific creative practices in designing for public and institutional spaces.  I researched content and images for [The National Building Museum][2], [The National September 11 Memorial & Museum][3], and [The National Museum of American Jewish History][4].  Even the most menial tasks sparked my imagination around changing standards of archives, memory, and social culture.  The work enthralled me, and I was honored to contribute.  The diverse and talented personalities working at the studio made it hard for me to leave.  I&#8217;ll miss everyone, as much as I&#8217;ll cherish the time in the coming weeks to work on finals.
