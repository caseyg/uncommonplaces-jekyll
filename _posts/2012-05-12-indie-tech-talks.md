In producing this series, I&#8217;m looking to get tinkerers we don&#8217;t usually hear from on stage for tech savvy audiences that love their work. An integral component of this is the host, [Andy Nealen][2], who brings out the speakers&#8217; insights through informed questions. He&#8217;s got a robust background in computer science and is a successful indie game developer himself, so he knows what he&#8217;s talking about. The first two talks from [Scott Anderson][3] and [Kaho Abe][4] were well attended and almost the entire audience stuck around for an hour after each talk to swap ideas and play games. Check out the posters for the past events below (designed by [Colin Snyder][5] also of Babycastles) and [look out for the next talk][6] when we resume the series in September.
