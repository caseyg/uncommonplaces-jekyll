Tonight, 8pm EST, join us at [BAGnewsNotes][1] for a live online discussion of Alan Chin&#8217;s photographs of the 2004 election. Photographers and visual academics ask if we are moving beyond identity politics in the electoral campaign and what impact the changing political narrative has on how the elections are photographed.Â  I&#8217;ve produced this event, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the conversation.
