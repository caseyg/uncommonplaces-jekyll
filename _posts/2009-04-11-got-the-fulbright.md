I got a letter in the mail from the Fulbright commission yesterday.  They&#8217;re giving me a 10 month grant to work in Ethiopia.  Stoked!

I&#8217;ll be working with Sudden Flowers, a youth video cooperative in Ethiopia&#8217;s capital.  I worked with Sudden Flowers [last summer][1]. You can read my Fulbright application materials [here][2].  The grant period starts in August.  Between now and then, I&#8217;ll build on the amazing intellectual and creative resources I&#8217;ve tapped into at [Parson&#8217;s Communication, Design, and Technology][3] department to prepare for the trip.  While Sudden Flowers works mainly in video, their collaborative production methods allow for a multiplicity of creative projects.  During my last trip, Sudden Flowers director Daniel Negatu and I spent a lot of time cooking up imaginative schemes for facilitating social justice media practices.  I&#8217;m brimming with enthusiasum.
