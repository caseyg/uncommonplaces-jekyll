Random Album Art via Facebook.

To Do This  
1 &#8211; Go to &#8220;wikipedia.&#8221; Hit “random”  
or click[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random][1]  
The first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.

2 &#8211; Go to &#8220;Random quotations&#8221;  
or click <http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3>  
The last four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.

3 &#8211; Go to flickr and click on “explore the last seven days”  
or click <http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days>  
Third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover.

4 &#8211; Use photoshop or similar to put it all together.

5 &#8211; Post it to FB with this text in the &#8220;caption&#8221; and TAG the friends you want to join in.

*Oh, I guess we need school to write the algorithms.  Right.*
