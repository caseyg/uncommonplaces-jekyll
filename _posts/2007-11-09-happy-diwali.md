To get everything coordinated, I have been in touch with DLR Prerna, the NGO in Darjeeling that I worked with my first trip there. Last night, I got an email from a colleague there wishing me Happy Diwali. Of course I had to go[ look it up][2]. I delight in being offered greetings so far outside of my daily reality from people I&#8217;ve had very good times with. Happy Diwali!
