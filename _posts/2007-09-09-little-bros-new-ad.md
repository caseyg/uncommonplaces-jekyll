My little brother Matt is an internet entrepreneur.

At 17, he is launching his second season of apparel for freestyle skiers on his site, <a href="http://echeadwear.com/" target="_blank">EC Headwear</a>. This all started when my mom got him crochet needles and yarn for Christmas. He immediately started cranking out hats and selling them to his buddies. After several months of spending all his free time crocheting, it occurred to him that he should outsource. Matt placed an order for several thousand hats from a factory in China. Now, he is expanding the product line to gloves and shirts. One of his first investments was a dye-cut sticker printer. He used his sticker machine to make several thousand stickers for [Freeskier Magazine][1] in exchange for a full page ad (value $7,000). Now, it&#8217;s time for another ad and he wants Big Sis&#8217; help with the photography. This is the message I got:

> Mom had the idea of you coming home one weekend and doing a photoshoot for my new Freeskier ad. She said you could prolly use it for some class. Any interest?

My response:

> As I have changed departments at school, commercial photography no longer serves as homework assignments. Thank goodness. If you can make me one of these, I might consider it a fair trade though: http://macs.hackaday.com/2007/06/26/nes-lightgun-wiimote-mod/
