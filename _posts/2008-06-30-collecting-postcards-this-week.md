I’m heading back to the tea garden today.  The farmers in Ambote, the hamlet where we had the meetings I reported on, are going to be dropping off their postcard responses today.  I have meetings lines up for the whole week in other hamlets.  The goal is to collect all the responses by the 6th.  The NGO has a great meeting with their board over the weekend where they shared the postcard booklets.  The board was very enthusiastic, which has trickled down to the NGO staff.  I still don’t have a dedicated translator.  That’s becoming part of the adventure.

Did you see that the Grokhaland agitation make the New York Times?  It’s in the Travel section! Ha!  Have a [look…][1] Kiran Desai&#8217;s novel mentioned in the first and last paragraphs of the article has been met with heated debate here.  I finally went and got myself a copy which I plan to read this week.

More when I’m back on line.
