With the blog being so quiet, several people have contacted me wanting to hear about Ethiopia.  Here in Rio, I’m coddling a streak of indulgent introversion, which is much needed before I get back to New York to start the semester.  When I’m not journaling or soaking in the unique urban landscape, I’m hanging out with friends I haven’t seen in far too long.

You’ll get your report back.  Pardon my moment of vacation.  <img src="http://uncommonplaces.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
