As an outgrowth of [the previous workshops I ran][1] at Addis Ababa University, I&#8217;m offering a four part visual literacy and photography series through the University&#8217;s English Language Improvement Center. Yesterday&#8217;s talk was a lot of fun. Student and professors from several departments attended. We viewed an analyzed work by photographers from Richard Avadon to Lolo Veloko to Lise Sarfati, not to mention Seydou Keita, whose photograph is used on the flyer. Quite a number of students have expressed interest in next week&#8217;s topic. If you&#8217;re in Addis Ababa, do stop by.
