Now that I&#8217;ve been to this 2nd grade class at Menelik II Primary School a few times, there&#8217;s only moderate commotion and excitement from the kids when I visit. The last time, when boredom with the science lesson had reached a peak, a bunch of them devised a new diversion and turned the cameras in their OLPC XO laptops on me.

When I looked up from taking this picture, four other kids were holding their laptops up above my head to take pictures of me. The teacher was relieved when I encouraged them to get back to their lesson even though I wanted to egg them on and see what they&#8217;d make.
