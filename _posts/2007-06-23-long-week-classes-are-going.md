This has been a long week of class. I have found myself feeling overwhelmed and lethargic, hence the lack of blogging. Tricia is here, which is lovely. I do enjoy many people in the group, but I get a little bugged out by the group dynamic. I have never traveled in a group and now I know why. I have missed hanging out with my lovely Brazilian friends. Tonight though! There&#8217;s a festa junina in St. Teresa.

Alright, let&#8217;s a quick visual recap:

Thursday I took more pictures of Fernanda after our Portuguese session. It was a good session and we chatted in Portuguese mostly about the various men that are pursuing her and about the anticipated arrival of minha namorada&#8230;

Friday night was a little birthday bash for Livia. We went to <a href="http://www.guiadasemana.com.br/detail.asp?/Champanharia_Ovelha_Negra/NOITE/RIO_DE_JANEIRO/&a=1&ID=8&cd_place=13619&cd_city=36" target="_blank">Ovelha Negra</a> in Botafogo, a champagne bar with good atmosphere frequented by a rugged sophisticated crowd, as far as I could read.

  I ended up hanging out with on of Livia&#8217;s friends&#8217; Joanna afterwards, doing the good old plastic tables and beer on the sidewalk. She&#8217;s fantastic. We just chattered for hours. Finally I decided to make my way home because I had to pick Tricia up from the airport at 8:30 in the morning. We wandered through the streets of Lapa and I eventually got into a cab. Lapa is one of the more congested night spots on Fridays. Where we hung out was outside the hub (so much so that Joanna&#8217;s friend joked that I should stop jabbering so loud in English or we&#8217;d get robbed!), but the most crowded part was just overflowing with people. Men would just come up and say crap like they loved you or other inane pick up lines in English, and then persist regardless of your response. I briefly ran into Stacy, and her friend Isabela. I hear people shouting from across the crowd, &#8220;Ida! Ida!&#8221; I felt so popular! I would have staid, but I needed to get a little sleep.

  The next day, I hung out in the airport for a few hours as the flight was late and the internet was down at the apartment so I didn&#8217;t check the status before leaving. I hung out with Sara and Leon, two other students, who just got in and were waiting for the next flight of some 10 students. Eventually Tricia and the rest arrived and I leaped into her lap and it was a jubilant reunion in the airport. Yay!

  We mellowed out for the weekend, walking on the beach and watching the sunset on Arpoador, the rocks between Copacabana beach and Ipanema. We even saw Peter trolling around with his medium format camera. The rocks are gorgeous and I found it hard to not compulsively take pictures. Peter is shooting a portfolio there, has been working on it for maybe six months or more.

  That night we had our opening dinner for the course. The class ate at a restaurant at Copacabana and then wandered around looking for some night happening to get crazy at. (Gosh, I&#8217;m feeling beat&#8230; I have a cold today, again&#8230;. I&#8217;ll continue this soon.)
