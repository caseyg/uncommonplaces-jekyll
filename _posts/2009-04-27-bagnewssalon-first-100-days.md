Another [BAGnewsSalon][1] is coming up.  Huge thanks to Michael Shaw and [Cara Finnegan][2] for taking up many of my responsibilities as producer for this one as I wrap up my time at the New School.  Looking forward to the conversation!

This Salon will examine a cross-section of Obama Administration images leading up to this 100-day mark. We hope to consider various factors, including how the White House frames issues via pictures; what the images say about the character and capacities of Obama and his team; and whether the images evidence a new tone and attitude in the country now. The BAGnewsSalon is an on-line, real-time discussion of selected images between invited guests on teh BAGnewsNotes blog.

Discussants participating include professors Loret Steinberg (R.I.T.) and Nathan Stormer (U. of Maine), historian Michael Steinberg, photographer Brian Ulrich, Daryl Lang (PDN), David Schonauer (American Photo), host Michael Shaw, moderator Cara Finnegan (U. of Illinois), and salon producer Ida Benedetto.
