[<img class="size-full wp-image-1180 alignleft" title="Boston Fair Trade" src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/picture-1.png" alt="Picture 1" width="147" height="226" />][1]This Saturday in Boston, a fair trade apparel company [The Autonomie Project][2]  is co-hosting a [Celebration of of Fair Trade][1].  The afternoon of activities includes the exhibition of &#8220;From One Farmer to Another: Postcards in Solidarity&#8221; that I have been working on with Santa Anita La Union in Guatemala and Sanjukta Vikas Sanstha in India.  The exhibition was [kicked off in Indianapolis][3] in the fall.  The Autonomie Project is anticipating attendance of over 1,000 people.  I hope some of them will send me their thoughts on the project.  I unfortunately can&#8217;t be in Boston this weekend for the event.   One of my Guatemalan colleagues, Omar Mejia of [Cafe Conciencia][4], will be speaking about his work with the coffee cooperatives.
