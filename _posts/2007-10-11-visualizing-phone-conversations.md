The current assignment for my Interaction class involved redesigning either a cell phone, ATM, or search page interface to make it more playful without interrupting it&#8217;s functionality. After spinning through some ideas, it occurred to me that producing a visualization of each phone conversation or text message back-and-forth would be pretty playful. I started looking into it and found a few encouraging projects [<a href="http://www.conduitgallery.com/artist_pgs/quinn.htm" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://textarc.org/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.evsc.net/v6/htm/cinematic.htm" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://www.chrisbenjaminsen.com/temp/flash9/1.swf" target="_blank">4</a>]. While looking for info on Jared Ficklin&#8217;s Sound Visualization workshop at the [Flashforward Conference][1] last year, I came across a youTube video of a Ruben&#8217;s Tube demonstration.

I am amused.
