    <img class="alignnone" src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/08-06-08strike05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="268" /><br /> There were some clashes the day before at a Gorkhaland protest, so the district went on strike the following day.<span> The district of Darjeeling has renewed its agitation for statehood which they will call Gorkhaland. </span>My meetings were canceled; all the restaurants were closed, as well as the Internet cafes. <span> </span>The only economic activity I saw was the sale of newspapers.<span> </span>The only people in the street were school children (school was still session) and disoriented Bengali tourists.<span> I took some picture of the closed market.  Note the Gorkhaland flag in the 3rd picture.  They are all over the streets.</span>

            I spendt the day working on my laptop from my balcony watching the clouds roll across the hills.<span> </span>Some backdoor economic activity is going on, but not much.<span> </span>I am online thanks to a friend’s connection through his bluetooth phone.<span> </span>I will be going to the tea garden tomorrow to start working on the postcard project.  We send the postcard booklets down to the garden in a milk truck, the only vehicles allowed on the road aside from police and medical assistance.<span> </span>If the strike is still on, we will have to walk most of the way to the garden. Today there was a protest, hundreds of Darjeeling residents marching and chanting peacefully and fervently for Gorkhaland.  The march was followed by a rally in the town square.</span>
