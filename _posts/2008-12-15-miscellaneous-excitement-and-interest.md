This past week has been exciting and the next looks like it will follow suit. The moon was [huge and beautifully full][1] like it hasn’t been for 15 years, with extremes in tidal activity to accompany it. The New School’s Faculty Senate [voted no confidence][2] in president Bob Kerrey last Wednesday after the 5th provost in 7 years left and Kerrey appointed himself provost.  Meetings, protests, and direct actions are planned throughout the coming week. The [International Center of Photography][3] held a seminar this past weekend called [What is Real? Documentary Photography and the Politics of Truth][4], consisting of rehashed angst about the digital age from ICP faculty and informed inquiries into visuality and the heterochronic by faculty from Princeton’s [Program in Media and Modernity][5].

The [short video documentary on game testing][6] that I shot last weekend has already gotten me work filming events for [Parsons][7]&#8216; fashion department (I probably won&#8217;t be posting that footage, but paid work is nice). My thesis class final presentation for the semester went well, though I have some huge design problems ahead of me for the Spring.  And now, I’m knee-deep in Actionscript programming.
