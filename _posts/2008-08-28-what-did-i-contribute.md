[Sudden Flowers][1] is doing [sophisticated work][2].  I was impressed to realize the limited intellectual and material resources they have to do it with.  Being in Ethiopia reminded me of how spoiled rotten I am studying at [Parsons][3] in New York City.  Our technology is always cutting the cutting edge.  Ripe ideas for innovation and creativity are so prevalent that they practically choke you with their sweetness.  I overextend myself to take advantage of it all.  Sudden Flowers is the kind of organization that most needs these resources.  They are deeply involved in [issues affecting][4] the youth of Addis Ababa. They have an appetite for art tempered with an insistence on practicality and results. They are relentless in their desire to improve the circumstances of the talented and vivacious kids that I had the good fortune to hang out with there.

I gave them detailed feedback on web design plans and their training manual.  I developed resource list of blogs and websites that will help them find wider applications for their already successful methods.  I gave technical trainings on Photoshop.  I had a copy of [Good Magazine][5] and [Video for Change][6] with me that the project directors enthusiastically read and discussed.

With Sudden Flowers, I found the exact opposite of the problem I find at school.  At Parsons, we are surrounded by intellectual and technical resources while suffering from a dearth of analysis for the inspiring application of them.  This results in constant, even compulsive refinement of aesthetic and technical precision in an echo chamber of praise.  The appetite to do meaningful work is there.  The analysis and opportunities are what’s missing.  Ever since [I read We Make the Road By Walking][7] in the spring, I have had [Myles Horton][8]’s assertion running through my head: “I say it’s not important to be good, it’s important to be good for something.”  Sudden Flowers has all the creative impulse, analytical precision, and principles grounded in justice to continue making media that is good for healing unjustified wounds and moving resources to those who will make inspirational use of them.  I just used some of my design school oversaturation to showed them where to find more creative sparks for their dry leaves, and I’m very glad for the opportunity to do so.
