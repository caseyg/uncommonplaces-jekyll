Researching images at my internship on a completely unrelated topic, I came across this cartoon. It&#8217;s from 1882.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948" title="robotmonster" src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/robotmonster.jpg" alt="robotmonster" width="500" height="590" />

The text accompanying the image is pitifully unrevealing. Internet searches tell me that The Oliver Corporation produced farming equipment. The monster is evidence of the vibrant imagination around mechanization and industrialization and serves as a curious precursor to 20th century genres of film and fiction.
