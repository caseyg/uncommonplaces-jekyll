Yesterday, [Not For Tourists][1] [threw a party][2] at [Idlewild Books][3] to celebrate a new partnership.  Idlewild will now be selling Not For Tourist neighborhood maps.  This bookstore is [dangerous][4] for travel addicts and itinerant spirits.  Books are organized by location, with guides, fiction, non-fiction, and cartography grouped together.  I spent much time salivating over the selection before turning my attention to the free wine and sociable urbanites that run Not For Tourists.  Congrats to everyone involved in the partnership.
