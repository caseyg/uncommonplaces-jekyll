This short video about Thai Le&#8217;s physical computing project, Organic Spaces, was commissioned by the Design & Technology Department at Parsons.  Designed for the department lobby, Organic Spaces created a visually stunning feedback system based on movement through the space.  Students loved observing and interacting with the project.  Organic Spaces may just inspire more ambitious physical computing endeavors, which is why the department was so eager to document Thai&#8217;s work.
