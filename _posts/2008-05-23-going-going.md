I played [Go][1] in [my favorite Greenwich Village chess shop][2] on Tuesday.  I was invariably the only woman in the place.  I&#8217;m teaching my friend Alexander to play. He&#8217;s hooked, even though I keep beating him. The great thing is I will feel so very accomplished the day he beats me. I love it. Sometimes I feel like if my life had gone differently, I would have ended up a mathematician.
