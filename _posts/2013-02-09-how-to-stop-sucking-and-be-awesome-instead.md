> If you&#8217;re reading this abstract, you&#8217;re not awesome enough. Attend this session to unlock the secrets of Jeff Atwood, world famous blogger and industry leading co-founder of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Learn how you too can determine clear goals for your future and turn your dreams into reality through positive-minded conceptualization techniques.* Within six to eight weeks, you&#8217;ll realize the positive effects of Jeff Atwood&#8217;s wildly popular Coding Horror blog in your own life, transporting you to an exciting new world of wealth, happiness and political power.

[Jeff Atwood&#8217;s presentation][1] goes over a 3 step plan to awesome.  
1. Embrace the Suck  
2. Do It in Public  
3. Pick Stuff That Matters  
([Download the Power Point presentation][2])

The middle point is particularly relevant to me as I muster the courage to blog more and more openly.
