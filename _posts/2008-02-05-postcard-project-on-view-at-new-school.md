The [postcard project][1] I am working on between fair trade communities in Guatemala and India is currently on view at the New School in conjunction with the conference, [&#8220;Is an Interdisciplinary Field of Memory Studies Possible?&#8221;][2] The exhibit will be up through Sunday (I believe) on the 2nd floor of 65 5th Ave. I will be at the conference Friday afternoon and all day Saturday. Looking forward to seeing you there!

**02/15/08 &#8211; The work will be up indefinitely if you are still interested in going to see it.*

**04/07/08 &#8211; The show is down now.  Thanks so much for everyone who came, especially those who offered such insightful feedback.  You remind me why I keep my standards high.*
