The strike is back on in two hours for the next 45 days. While it&#8217;s possible it won&#8217;t last that long, the general sentiment is that it is for real this time and will continue for quite some time. Hopefully things remain peaceful. The strike that ended the agitation in the late 1980&#8242;s lasted for 40 days. I might be lagging with email responses in the mean time. In addition to internet access being scant, I&#8217;ll be heading down to the tea garden at the end of the week. Generally, I&#8217;m exhausted from buying supplies and trying to get things done in the midst of diminishing resources as stocks have been bought up and establishments of all kinds are poorly attended in the absence of the tourists. The only foreigners left are the ones working on projects or for NGOs (maybe 20 of us in all? And the West Bengal intelligence officers are following each of us.). No Bengalis are in town. My friends studying Tibetan took off for Kathmandu. It&#8217;s getting quiet in Darjeeling. The weather has been wonderful. I am sunburned from sitting on my balcony all day yesterday staring at the snow capped mountains and reading Malcolm Gladwell. I&#8217;ll give myself a few more days to chill out after the initial pre-strike frenzy and then get to work with the tea farmers, which only looks like work from here. Once I get started, I will have a lot of fun.
