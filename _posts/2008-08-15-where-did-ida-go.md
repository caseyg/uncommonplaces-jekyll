Answer: I went to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia where the internet connection is worse than any other city I have been to. After my initial post, I couldn’t get a good enough connection to log into wordpress. It often took over half an hour to log into my gmail account and view a few new messages. One person told me that the internet connection is via satellite, so in the rainy season the signal gets slow. I repeated this to someone else, and they skeptically shook their head, asserting that it is this slow all year round.

Over the next few days, I’ll post about my experience in Ethiopia and working with [Sudden Flowers][1]. I’m currently in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where the internet connection is as swift as the pick-pockets.
