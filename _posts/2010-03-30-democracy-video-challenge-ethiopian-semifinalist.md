[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1781" title="DVC" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images//2010/03/DVC-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="250" />][1]Last Thursday, the [United States Embassy][2] announced three Ethiopian semifinalists for the [Democracy Video Challenge][3], an annual competition sponsored by YouTube and the U.S. State Department.  Short videos completing the phrase “Democracy is…” are submitted from across the globe. The Ethiopian semi-finalists’ films will be submitted to the continent-wide competition. Global winners will be voted by the YouTube audience in May. Last year, the first year of the completion, no entries from Ethiopia were submitted. The U.S. Embassy was eager to change that this year.

I helped by running a workshop on the competition in November. In information sessions, the embassy identified concerns on the part of local filmmakers about delivering a powerful message in three minutes, as the competition required, and competing with the work from countries well practices in sophisticated film and animation techniques. I attempted to address these concerns by analyzing past competition winners and sharing examples of techniques for quickly communicating abstract ideas through film. The results were stunning. 30 entries were submitted, making the Ethiopian selection among of the most competitive in Africa.

Here are the semi-finalist films: (See all the entries from Ethiopia [here][4].)
