[Sudden Flowers][1] produces short films on the lives of youth in Addis Ababa who are growing up without parents thanks to the [AIDS crisis][2].  The collective is made up of 18 youth and several project directors.  The youth write and shoot their own stories.  By exploring their personal narratives in a controlled and supportive environment the youth move through destructive emotions like shame and guilt encouraged in a society fragmented by HIV/AIDS.  They learn to see their difficult past experiences as external challenges that they have overcome rather than reflections of their character or capabilities.  In addition, acting in each others films as parents or other family members encourages the youth to reexamine the situations of their own families.  They often develop empathy where before they felt angry and betrayed.  The production of the films is a therapeutic process and an opportunity to gain technical and creative skills.

The youth also provide a valuable service to [Hope for Children][3], the umbrella organization that Sudden Flowers started under.  The films offer information about the perspectives and needs of the youth as defined by them. Sudden Flowers seeks to integrate the films in to the reporting mechanisms of the organization. This is where their approach differs from other youth media projects.  The impact of the services and programs offered by the aid organization can be sized up in relation to the narratives told by the youth.  The dissemination of the films integrates the youth’s perspective into the planning and evaluation of the organizations helping them.

Traditionally, organizations like Hope for Children use statistical and text based mediums to document and report on their activities.  Visuals come into play as static, posed photographs or straight photojournalism of proceedings of the organization.  Sudden Flowers sees the films they produce as a rich way to preface the voice of the beneficiaries in reporting on the organizations accomplishments and a means of gauging needs and planning future programs.

When I came, Sudden Flowers was just settling into a new office space.  They now have plenty of room for workshops and production.  The youth came on Sundays to run skill shares among themselves.  A few of the youth a pretty adept on the computer and generously help the rest, whose skills might be stronger in acting or production.  Toward the end of my time there, I ran photoshop workshops on a one-on-one basis introducing such concepts as layers, histograms, and color theory.  These images are from the informal skill shares they were working on when I first arrived.
