I enjoyed my first encounter with the [Hacks/Hackers MeetUp group][1] this weekend, which brings hackers and journalists together to think in new directions about journalism and digital media.  [The Great Urban Hack][2] at [Eyebeam][3] was a two-day, overnight hackathon where 12 teams worked on original projects.

My group worked on a reporting interface that would answer the 5 W&#8217;s of journalism; *who*, *what*, *where*, *when* and *why* (as well as *how*).  By having journalists answer each of these questions about their story using a mix of mediums they feel best convey the answer, 5W delivers the full story concisely and interactively in a familiar format.  The site can serve both news junkies wanting the most current, relevant information about stories as well as those who missed the slow evolution of a story and want to get caught up quickly.

      It was a lot of fun starting something from scratch with a bunch of talented strangers. You can read about the projects that the rest of the groups put together on the <a href="http://hackshackers.com/2010/11/08/open-all-night-the-great-urban-hack-nyc/">Hacks/Hackers blog</a>, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-berkowitz/the-great-urban-hack-not-_b_779964.html">Huffington Post</a> and the <a href="http://newschallenge.org/blog/hacks-and-hackers-collaborate-inaugural-great-urban-hack">Knight News Challenge site</a>.

      Throughout the event, presenters showed off their work and floated around the room to offer input on the group projects.  I enjoyed picking <a href="http://twitter.com/hqu">Hong Qu</a>&#8216;s brain on UI design (he&#8217;s done it for YouTube and bit.ly) and talking to <a href="http://eyebeam.org/people/jeff-crouse">Jeff Crouse</a> about the development of <a href="http://eyebeam.org/projects/unlogo">unLogo</a>, a web service that replaces logos in videos.  <a href="http://tahirhemphill.com/portfolio/case.html">Tahir Hermphill</a>, Eyebeam resident and creator of <a href="http://hiphopwordcount.com/">Hip Hop Word Count</a> dropped by, and I had an awesome conversation with Columbia Journalism School student <a href="http://twitter.com/camilosmith">Camilo Smith</a> when he stopped in during the early hours of the morning on his way to cover the NYC Marathon.

      Thanks so much to my team members for all the fun and hard work and thanks to Hacks/Hackers for organizing the event.
