> Wanderlust Projects is about a lot of thingsâ€”discovery, history, and just reminding people to be curious about abandoned structures beyond the &#8220;ruin porn&#8221; aspect, though they don&#8217;t have anything against it per se. The problem with ruin porn, says Benedetto, is that &#8220;like most uncreative pornographic practices it&#8217;s just producing what you&#8217;ve already seen, not actually a practice of looking.&#8221; Austin adds, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I love more than a good photograph of peeling paint, but if your only relationship with these kinds of places is the aesthetic, you&#8217;re missing out on a lot.&#8221;
