I am so reluctant to clean up after last night because I don&#8217;t want to believe it&#8217;s over. I had people come to the apartment for a goodbye/happy birthday party. This didn&#8217;t quite top the sending off from my first trip to Guatemala. My friends there brought me to a mariachi bar, I had two shots of tequila, started bawling, and continued to dance ranchero while crying hysterically for about three hours. That was ridiculous. Last night was plain fun and endearing. About 20 people, mostly queers and mostly Brazilians, chatted it up, gawked at the view of the neighbors in the building across the street, and made half pie-in-the-sky, half serious plans to visit in NYC. They sang happy birthday in Portuguese for me toward midnight, Aninha holding out her lighter for me to blow out. After everyone headed out at around 1am, I putted around the apartment slightly drunk and on the verge of tears for about a half hour before getting in bed. I am going to miss the friends I made here! My flight leaves at 7pm, so I am leaving Copacabana at around 4. Gotta pack. Wish me luck!
