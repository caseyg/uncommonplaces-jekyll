My four months here as a strategy intern have been more productive and inspiring that I could have anticipated. The whole team is smart, talented, and motivating. It was a lot of fun to lend my skills in content development and conceptual thinking to the stunning design projects that Big Spaceship is famous for.

As part of the mentoring benefits that come with working for cheap at a successful digital agency, Directory of Strategy Ivan Askwith and Copywriter Jessica Berta worked with me to improve my writing. I wrote two blog posts for the Big Spaceship [Think Blog][2]. The first, [Everybody Alone Together Now: Social Networking and Spymaster][3], addresses the explosion of a Twitter based MMO and the insight that MMO gaming might have for social networking. The second, [When Global Participation Is the Default][4], considered the negative ramifications of regional media going global over the internet as experienced by the Israeli communications company Cellcom.Â  An extended version of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Global Participation Is the Default</span> can be read on my [portfolio site][5].

In my spare time between brainstorming sessions and proposal writing, I researched identification with characters in playable media (i.e, games and interactive narrative). By examining the ways that people connect with characters in different digital narrative systems, I hope to offer designers a set of guidelines for creating moving characters that suit the experiences they are out to create.
