The Kicker, Columbia Journalism Review’s blog, [is suggesting that][1] the recent occupation at NYU ended after power and internet were cut off in the Kimmel Student Center.  Is that really the case?  The [occupation’s blog][2] says that [the administration refused to negotiate][3].  The occupation at the New School in December ended after in person negotiations between administrators and student occupiers.  At the time, I was disappointed with [the media efforts][4] of the New School’s occupation.  The blog they published was often cryptic and inconclusive.  [Covering events one nigh][5]t from outside the building, I was amazed at how difficult communication was between occupiers inside and protesters outside.  The efforts were ultimately successful though.  Why did things go so differently at NYU?  Is the different outcome really a result of the activism becoming dependent upon its media outreach?
