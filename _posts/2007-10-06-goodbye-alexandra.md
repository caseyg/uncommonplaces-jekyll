Alexandra Boulat, the iconic conflict photographer, died yesterday at the age of 45. She suffered a brain aneurysm while working in Gaza this past June. She was place in a medically induced coma and never recovered.

Miss Boulat was at the top of the field. She was critical of how we picture war and made powerful contributions to the style, character, and depth of photographic coverage of conflict. I was devastated reading the <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/newswire/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003654762" target="_blank">obituary</a> published by Photo District News. I have long admired Miss Boulat&#8217;s work and heard her speak on several occasions. I felt especially inspired and encouraged by her presence in the field as sharp and conscientious woman. The photojournalism word does award good work regardless of the photographer&#8217;s gender, but navigating the field as a woman can be exhausting. Her contributions have given me faith in the power and potential of photograph.

Her work can been viewed on the [VII Photo][1] website.
