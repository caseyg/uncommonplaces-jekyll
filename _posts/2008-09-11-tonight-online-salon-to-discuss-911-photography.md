Tonight [BAGnewsNotes][1], a progressive blog that analyzes photography and visual politics, is hosting a live chat salon titled [***9/11: Looking Back From Now***][2].  Starting at 8pm EST, academics, photojournalists, photography editors, and you if you like will discuss how photographs relating the the events of 9/11/2001 are seen now.  I helped select photographs for discussion in collaboration with [Michael Shaw][3] who publishes BAGnewNotes.

  On August 7th, 1924, the French tight rope walker Philippe Petit spent 45 minutes walking back and forth on a tight rope wire between the Twin Towers.  (Screen grab from documentary trailer, <a href="http://www.manonwire.com/">Man on Wire</a>)
