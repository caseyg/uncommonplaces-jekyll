It looks like someone did <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/nyregion/27consulate.html" target="_blank">a memorial bombing</a> at the Mexican consulate here in New York for the anniversary of the death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Will" target="_blank">Brad Will</a>. Brad was an exuberant, committed activist and videographer who worked with <a href="http://indymedia.org" target="_blank">Indymedia</a>, among other organizations, to document the struggles of the disenfranchised groups, especially in Latin America. He was shot dead one year ago today while filming on the barricades of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Oaxaca_protests" target="_blank">Oaxaca uprising</a>. The seven months of protest in Oaxaca began with a teacher&#8217;s strike and grew to a general resistance to the governor, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. Video tapes show that the men who shot Brad were probably government employees. The Oaxaca state government concluded that he was killed by APPO members by shots at close range, which is unlikely considering the evidence. The Mexican federal government has yet to conclude their investigation. Brad&#8217;s parents and their investigator hope to release their own report soon.

The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/nyregion/27consulate.html" target="_blank">reports</a> that links are being draw between this morning&#8217;s bombing of the Mexican consulate and a bombing in 2005 of the building where the British Consulate is. A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/05/uk.consulate/index.html" target="_blank">CNN article</a>, as well as <a href="http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2007/10/92240.html" target="_blank">comments on Indymedia</a>, suggest that the actual target of that bombing might have been another tenant in the same building, a private firm headed by <a href="http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/company_profile/company_leadership/sub/fosler.html" target="_blank">Gail Fosler</a>, the director of Caterpillar Inc. <a href="http://www.catdestroyshomes.org/article.php?id=349" target="_blank">Protests</a> against Caterpillar Inc. decried the company&#8217;s sale of bulldozers to Israel for use in demolishing Palestinian homes.

I&#8217;ll be going to the memorial for Brad today at St. Mark&#8217;s Church. You can see my pictures from the <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/gallery-show/G0000saHJK8rKDhc" target="_blank">demonstration</a> and <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=20061113103315653" target="_blank">memorial</a> last year via the links.
