The beloved A server, digital hang out and public platform for the Communication Design and Technology department at Parsons, has crashed irreparably.  This means that any links on this blog to a http://a.parsons.edu address are dead.  My apologies.  If you want something that should be available at such a link, just drop me a line.  I have all the files, they&#8217;re just not online at the moment.  By best to those holding the A server&#8217;s Irish wake this week at McSorley&#8217;s in NYC.  I am there in spirit.
