Check out today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/technology/22library.html?_r=1&oref=slogin" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> about libraries that are turning down offers from Google and Microsoft to digitize their collections. The title is curiously inaccurate, suggesting that &#8220;Libraries Shun Deals to Place Books on Web.&#8221; Many of these libraries, the article continues, are putting their collections online through the open source non-profit, <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/" target="_blank">Open Content Alliance</a>, which is part of the <a href="http://www.archive.org" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>. Seems that the private book digitizers require that the books they scan be available only through their databases. The restriction is validated by many libraries because of price. Google and Microsoft will pay for the cost of scanning while the Open Content Alliance charges around $30 per book. Several foundations are giving libraries grants to cover these costs.

I use Google&#8217;s book search features often because, like many Google services, the interface is pleasing and efficient. If I find a book that might contain information I want, I usually track it down at a library. Copyrighted books are not fully visible. I rarely want to read them on-screen anyway. The Internet Archive provides full access, but this is limited to works no longer protected by copyright or, I am assuming, instances where licenses where granted.

Google controlling library content makes me nervious. I knew they were making an effort to scan library materials, but I assumed that most of their books were from commercial publishers looking to increase exposure. I am not sure what the breakdown is of Google&#8217;s book sources. Google is not an democratic entity, as much as their smart business practices use egalitarian principles to increase usage. I am glad that many libraries are savvy to this and choosing to use open source systems.

I am going to make a point to search the Internet Archive more often now and see if I find useful material. I&#8217;m pretty content searching four of five sources when doing research, be those internet databases or physical libraries.
