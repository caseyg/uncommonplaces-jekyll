Spreading from TV screens to laptops, smart phones and facebook feeds; spilling into classrooms, diy music venues, and major museum exhibitions- we are currently witnessing the rise of the digital game. Yet as the number of contemporary women gamers grows nearly equal to that of male gamers, gender bias in games and in the industry and culture that surround them, seems slow to die. HEY GIRL (GAMER) presents a panel of  
distinguished developers, artists, researchers, and students from the field to share their work and offer insights as to what gives and what’s at stake for ladies in this continually evolving media form.

Moderated by Sarah Schoemann, Graduate Research Assistant in the Game Innovation Lab at NYU’s Polytechnic Institute  
and featuring:

Ida Benedetto, co-founder of Antidote Games and member the indie arcade collective, Babycastles.

Jessy Jo Gomez, Design and Technology student at Parsons The New School of Design and former youth game designer with Global Kids.

Kaho Abe, Former Eyebeam fellow and current artist in residence at NYU Poly’s Game Innovation Lab.

Julia Deter, Award winning game artist and developer at Arkadium games.
