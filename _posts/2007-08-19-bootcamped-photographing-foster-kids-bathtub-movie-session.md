I made it through Bootcamp. My website is functional and I learned a lot about computer programing, digging up all that high school math. It&#8217;s hard to gracefully teach this much stuff in so short a time. I was cranky as all heck the last few days, in no mood for the final presentations. We formally presented our work to panels of reviewers, both Bootcamp teachers and faculty in the department. The feedback was flatly encouraging, which I find only a step better that roundly discouraging. They worked us so hard that the feedback the whole time from teachers was mostly encouraging, just to keep us going. The intellectual footholds were few. Fair enough, like I said, can&#8217;t quite manage this gracefully in such a short period of time. The conceptual glue will be fleshed out come the semester. Thanks to bootcamp, I should be able to keep up on the technical end.

The [website][1] still needs a lot of work. I need to use it to promote the postcard project. Anne of <a href="http://www.ftrn.org" target="_blank">The Fair Trade Resource Network</a> has been waiting for me to get her something like this, so she can use me to get funding for promoting art and documentary work on their site. I still need to do basic stuff like copy edit and add more postcards. It&#8217;s a good first draft really. I do a better job explaining the project in person than I do on the web though. Next step it to figure out design elements and narrative strategies that turn this from portfolio site into engaging web content.

Yesterday I went to Patterson, NJ for a shoot by the [Heart Gallery][2]. Najlah Hicks, one of my fellow students in Bootcamp, is an established photojournalist who started this amazing project to support adoption of older kids in foster care. She brings in established and renowned photographers to do portraits of them. The portraits help their chances of getting adopted. The success rate is amazing given that the kids they photograph have been in the system for over 5 years, so they are considered hopeless cases, never to find a new home and family. I don&#8217;t have the exact numbers, but from the first round of shoots in 2005, when they photographed some 300 kids, over 100 have been fully adopted and another 50 or so are in the adoption process. The shoot yesterday was the last in a series of four done this year. 17 kids were photographed. I think 6 or 7 photographers and videographers were there, including Julie and Ed Kashi of <a href="http://talkingeyesmedia.org/" target="_blank">Talking Eyes Media</a>. I helped out <a href="http://www.karenpearson.com/" target="_blank">Karen Pearson</a> with her shoots. The kids were sweet, cooperative, and good natured. It was fun, but tragic at the same time because it&#8217;s evident that they have been through hell. Good thing they have someone like Najlah on their side.

Today was supposed to be a beach trip, but the possibility of rain is enough that it got canceled. Too bad. I need some good relaxation. But I also need to clean my room and do laundry and such, so it&#8217;s okay. I did watch [Shortbus][3] in the bathtub yesterday, which was wonderful. I enjoyed the film so much. It was uplifting and realistically fanciful. Realistically fanciful! That might have to be my new tagline.

And happy belated birthday Joanna! I totally need to send that sweetheart a copy of Shortbus&#8230; Look! I can finally sing happy birthday in Portuguese!
