Lunch yesterday with Livia and her friends, Andreana, Lisha, Joana, and Marian was very up beat. Livia and Lisha were excited to introduce me to Joana because Joana was a riot grrl in her teen years, so we&#8217;ve got something in common. Riot grrl is a sub-genera of punk that ferociously incorporates feminist values into an often macho music scene. In Portuguese, punk rock is pronounced with the epenthetic vowels at the end of each word, so it comes out more like *punky hockey *(the first *r* in *rock* being pronounced like an English *h*). I said I couldn&#8217;t do it, just couldn&#8217;t say it like that. They egged me on, and I said it sarcastically, and they all were terribly amused. Lisha said I had something of a Bahian accent, and asked if I knew what Bahia was. I said that of course I did, since foreigners who know nothing about Brazil will only think of the street festivals in Bahia and the beaches in Rio, and maybe the Amazon. (Though I have a few other reasons to know about Bahia.) This started some joke about Brazilians being wild jungle people, and Joana asked tongue-in-cheek if I had gotten my malaria shot. Livia said she had even been asked once when she was out of the country if people wear cloths in Brazil. It&#8217;s like the rest of the world hasn&#8217;t bothered to update their vision of Brazil since the conquistadors wrote their descriptions of indigenous life as if it were centered around loose, clean shaven women and cannibalism. The interesting thing is how keenly aware of this these educated young women are.

I met up with Peter after lunch to go check out some exhibits that he might want to take the class to. Going to <a href="http://www.museudoindio.org.br/" target="_blank">Museu do Índio</a> was an ironic follow up to the lunch time conversation. Their current exhibit is an amazing look at an indigenous amazonian group&#8217;s process of documenting their own cultural practices. The show is called *<span><span class="destaquesProgramacaoTituloMateria">Tisakisu: Tradição e Novas Tecnologias da Memória</span></span>*<span><span class="destaquesProgramacaoTituloMateria">. The exhibit uses both current and archival materials of certain ceremonies to explain how these practices figure into the lives of this group, and then shows the process of making the materials, how the people engaged with and thought of the process as an important way to preserve their own culture. The content of the exhibit was impressive and thorough. The curation of the show is what put it over the top. The dark rooms had hanging light boxes with black and white photographs, text panels under black lights interspersed with more photographs and video installations. </span></span>

  From there we went to Centro and grabbed a snack. The whole time we went to shows, Peter would be on and off the phone with Daniela, his assistant here in Brazil who helps plan and execute the course. The logistical part of planning this course seems difficult as it is dependent on speakers and trips to NGOs around Rio.

  We went to <a href="http://www.correios.com.br/institucional/conheca_correios/acoes_culturais/esp_cult_rj/ccc_rj.cfm" target="_blank">Centro Cultural Correios</a> to see some of the work up for <a href="http://www.fotorio.fot.br/2007/" target="_blank">FotoRio</a>, the biannual photography festival that is currently happening in Rio de Janeiro. Peter said there were a lot of jokes going around at some of the opening parties that FotoRio is the largest photography festival with no money. This was evident from the rather underwhelming show at CCC. Some of the work included was quite impressive, especially that of <a href="http://www.luizbraga.fot.br/" target="_blank">Luiz Braga</a>, who is from and works in the north of Brazil.

  Peter was toting around an 8mm camera and we stopped at one point for him to take a 10-second photograph of an old façade. In one of the old buildings, he pointed out a terma, which is a combination bar/bath house/brothel. I asked how he could tell, because it just looked like a bar to me. One indication is that the place was called a whiskey bar, but Peter said it was obvious to him, though he didn&#8217;t expect to see such a place in the museum district. We went to a few book stores and by 6pm I was exhausted from being on my feet. I enjoyed hanging out with Peter as he is always overflowing with stories and is so engaged with cultural happenings. I already feel motivated to see more of the city, take pictures, and get started with the class.
