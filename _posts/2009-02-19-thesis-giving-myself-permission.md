Progress with thesis has been slow thanks to other projects being active and exciting. The [political machinations][1] at school, combined with serious confusion and skepticism among Parsons students about the thesis exhibitions isn’t helping either.  The entire structure of the exhibitions has changed this year, resulting in stiffer competition for space.  In several departments, students are fronting their own money to rent space off campus for exhibitions to make sure that everyone’s work is represented.

I recently opted out of a great opportunity to participate in a photography workshop realizing that the week of hard work away from school would only drag more of my creative energy away from thesis.  The Narrative and Dynamic Systems [class][2] I am taking is opening up new possibilities for creating engaging digital experiences.  I am trying to stave off fears that it’s just too late to get good work done.  At least now I feel like I am asking the right questions, which is huge [progress from last semester][3].  Strangely, the drama over thesis exhibitions is helping take some of the pressure off of exhibiting work that I am prematurely critical of.  The Design and Technology thesis process is as much about the performance of an idea as the actual execution of it.  Have I performed enough to get the okay to actually make something?  I don’t know why I keep looking to others for this answer.  I’m the only one who can successfully give myself that permission.
