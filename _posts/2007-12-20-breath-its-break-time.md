Finals are over. I made it. What a trip.

Right now I am pulling myself together for a week at the family ski cabin. The plan is to drop off the exhausted laptop at Tekserve tomorrow for some repairs. That way, I can have a week of minimal computer use. It makes sense to take the week away to really get away. When I get back, I want to inventory what I did this past semester and assess my progress. I can assess better with just a bit of distance. And sleep! I slept 12 hours on Tuesday night after stint in the bath tub with bubbles and a drink. I am still cranky and spaced out, so I&#8217;ll go for another 12 hours tonight.

Today, amid shopping for gifts for others, I went on a minor book binge for myself. One of the most exciting things about breaks from classes is reading what I want. Here&#8217;s some books that I might read in whole or part over the course of the winter break:

*Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software* by Charles Petzold  
The first few chapters were assigned for Bootcamp over the summer, and I&#8217;m enjoying this coding thing.

*Pedagogy of the Oppressed* by Paulo Freire  
I need to work on the final project for the Brazil course, and this has been on my reading list for ages. It&#8217;s about time.

*How to Think Like a Great Graphic Designer* by Debbie Millman  
This was an impulse buy today. Based on feedback this semester, my design sense is not terribly sensible. I&#8217;m hoping this book will help.

*Graded Go Problems for Beginners* by Kano Yoshinori 9-dan  
For fun. My aunt gave me a lovely Go set for Christmas.

*The Art of Political Murder: Who Killed the Bishop?* by Francisco Goldman  
I went to [Goldman&#8217;s talk at OSI][1] and got a signed copy. It&#8217;s about Monsignor Gerardi&#8217;s assassination in Guatemala after releasing the truth report on human rights crimes.

*Fair Trade* by Jacqueline DeCarlo  
This is a Beginner&#8217;s Guide. I went to a book signing way back in May.

*Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders Who are Changing the World* written by Kerry Kennedy, photos by Eddie Adams   
Because, as one of my mentors says, I need more roll models.
