I have been elected as a representative of [Parsons][1] to [the New School][2]&#8216;s University Student Senate for the 2008-2009 academic year. I have been on the senate this past academic year, the first year the school has had a senate. We have positioned ourselves effectively to make a greater impact on the governance and social climate of the school. There&#8217;s another year of hard work ahead of us. And parities! We&#8217;ll be starting with an icecream social tomorrow night for all elected representatives (Thanks Peter for organizing this!).

Here&#8217;s the letter that Bob Kerry, president of the New School, sent out today:
