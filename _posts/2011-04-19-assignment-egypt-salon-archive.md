I&#8217;m a little late posting this over here, but the archive for the most recent BagNews Salon &#8220;Assignment Egypt,&#8221; which I produced, is up. Photographers and visual academic discussed news photos of Egypt’s 18-day revolution. Check it out over at [BagNews][1].

As always with the Salons, when you get a group of visually adept people discussing a small selection of charged photos, amazing insights result. Below are a few of my favorite quotes from the salon. Read more quotes in the [archive post][2].

&nbsp;

“This image shows us the level of commitment. Everyone here is willing to be vulnerable and confront the reality of the powers that are beyond them entirely.”

- Michelle Woodward, Photo Editor for Middle East Report

***Laura El-Tantawy / Burn Magazine** – Egyptian anti-government protesters sleep on the tires of a military tank stationed on Tahrir (Liberation) Square*.

&nbsp;

“This is a corollary to the tanks in the square. It’s like they are saying, ‘You’re got your tanks, we’ve got Facebook.’ they even made it out of rocks, the same rocks that a couple days later or a couple days before became projectiles.”

-Michael Shaw, Editor at BagNews
