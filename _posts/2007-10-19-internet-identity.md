I recently watch a friend freak out about her web presence. She works in social networking and deals with internet presence for various organizations every day. Something suddenly triggered her to be concerned about her own presence online. She hid all her old journal entries, started an anonymous blog, and continued to fret. I ran up against similar anxieties when I gave a workshop a few weeks ago for homeless youth service providers. Some of the social workers were terrified of putting their organization on the internet. After dealing with client confidentially every day, they weren&#8217;t comfortable with web 2.0 in any format. How is it that in these two very different scenarios, people seem to be scared about controlling their own public identity on the internet?

I have been mulling over these questions as I explore the blogging process here. When I let my thoughts on the topic wander, I inevitably flash back to a party about a year ago. It was at well attended New York City gathering of photography professionals. I ended up rather drunk and ungracefully told someone what I thought of the program they were running that I had recently participated in. I still cringe thinking of this moment. I was vulnerable in a room of many, many potential employers and generally influential people, and it didn&#8217;t go too well as soon as I relaxed into being sloppily honest. In a party atmosphere, I let my guard down.

The internet is a multi-use space, where standards and expectations vary as much as human activity. This can be confusing when suddenly that high school blog becomes a liability for getting a job. All the content falls into the same miscellaneously accessible space. If I can&#8217;t even keep form a professional event, mustn&#8217;t I be doing even more damage online? But we are writing in hypertext. I&#8217;m a bit behind the curve in finding <a href="http://mediatedcultures.net/" target="_blank">Michael Wesch</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE" target="_blank">The Machine is Us/ing Us</a>. I think it provides an interesting opportunity for internet identity. Nothing it newly indelible just because a few more people might see us working out our process. The anxiety levels are just a bit higher. <a href="http://www.danah.org/" target="_blank">Danah Boyd</a>, whose scholarship I am quickly becoming a fan of, recently wrote a <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/09/07/controlling_you.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> about controlling your online public appearance. The title of the post doesn&#8217;t specify that it&#8217;s online appearance she&#8217;s focused on. Her tips probably would have done me good at that party a year ago if I recontextualize them. The emphasis is active engagement, which seems like the smartest strategy to me.  I&#8217;ve noticed that google searches for some of my teachers turn up my blog posts as the top hits. This is amusing to me since the traffic on this blog is so minimal. The internet is a noisy place, so if I make enough thoughtful noise myself, I won&#8217;t have to worry about other people&#8217;s interpretations dominating my internet identity.  This blog is my best effort at relearning internet identity. It seems my friend mentioned at the beginning of this post is going through a similar process.
