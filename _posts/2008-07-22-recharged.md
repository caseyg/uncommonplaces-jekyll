I am usually beat after the semester, and this last was no exception. With 6 classes, student government, and all the work to get the postcard project together, I was ready to hit a wall by May. I still can’t believe I managed all A’s save for one class. The hard work was worth it as my financial aid package was generously padded. I will be returning for the next school year with my tuition fully covered.

In India, I focused on one thing, the postcard exchange, and achieved what I set out to do. (They’re all translated too! I’ll throw some up here soon.) In the rest of my time, I read voraciously, watched local politics unfold and socialized.

At Sanjukta Vikas Sanstha, the farmers were amazed at how much I read. When I went back down the second time, Lendup asked me if I had finished my book. “Yes,” I told him, “and I bought another one.” He laughed in amused disbelief.

Multi-tasking is fine, but the level I need to sustain it at in New York gets to be too much at times. I am getting better at it (thanks [David Allen][2] and [your critics][3]!). I achieved my goals in Darjeeling and recharged after a hectic semester. The next chapter in my summer adventure starts soon. I’m on my way to Ethiopia. Excited? Hells yea!
