I am a <a href="http://www.parsons.edu/apply/undergrad_special.aspx" target="_blank">BAFA</a> student at <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">The New School</a>. This means that I am earning two undergraduate degrees, a BA and a BFA, in five years through two different school at The New School University (<a href="http://www.parsons.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">Parsons</a> and <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/" target="_blank">Eugene Lang</a>). While I love this program as it allows be to be rigorous in both liberal arts and visual arts, the bureaucratic havoc I need to push through is maddening, especially during registration. The requirements shift a bit for BAFA students, but no one seems to agree on how exactly. I exacerbate the confusion by being a transfer student, by majoring in a new department at Lang, and by changing departments at Parsons. If there is a rule to bend, I have probably bent it over and tied it in a knot. These knots are the footing in the rope I climb to eventually make it through undergrad. While talking to my history adviser <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=1758" target="_blank">Paul Ross</a> about what to take next semester, he paused and asked, &#8220;So after this, you have <a href="http://www.awholenother.com/" target="_blank">a whole &#8216;nother</a> year?&#8221; He just cackled when I said yes. &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re going to be well educated.&#8221;

Yesterday I spent a few hours between different advising offices.

Office A &#8211; to confirm that I did not need to take university lecture courses since I transfered to the New School as a sophomore. Thank goodness.

Office B &#8211; to find out what the requirements are for Histoy, as it&#8217;s a new concentration, and if it is really going to be a problem that I don&#8217;t have enough lower level courses. We are assuming it will be okay.

Office C &#8211; to figure out what I need to take in Design & Technology next semester. No notes or paperwork had been passed onto this office though, so I was a totally anomaly and sent elsewhere.

Office D &#8211; to find out where my files from the Photography Department (my previous major at Parsons) went. We still don&#8217;t know.

Office E &#8211; to get information that should have gone to office C and try and track down Photography Department file.

I now have a rough idea of what I should take next semester to keep on track for graduating in May &#8217;09.
