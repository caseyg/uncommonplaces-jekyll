This morning I woke up with a terrible head cold. I figured it would happen sooner or later because I have encountered many people with colds. Something about the cool, but humid winter weather must be doing it. I spent the day in my hammock reading and working on some grammar exercises.

Even my grammar book is anticipating the Caetano Veloso concert on Tuesday!

Yesterday I ended up in Barra by accident. Barra is described by my guidebook at a neighborhood styled after an American suburb which is to be avoided. I was going to meet some friends for a hike, but there was some miscommunication about when we were meeting and how long it would take to get there. I met Stacy to catch the bus in Copacabana and we headed west. By the time we reached Barra where we were supposed to switch to the bus to take us to the nature reserve, it was getting close to sunset. Best not to go then&#8230; Stacy wanted to get herself a sweater while we were there, so we ventured into the shopping mall, Barra&#8217;s biggest attraction. I almost imploded. The place was so crowded! At least three time more crowded than any mall in the US I have been in. I did my best to be polite and patient, but when one of Stacy&#8217;s friends showed up and wanted to wait for more friends to hang out in the neighborhood, I had enough. I got on the bus by myself and headed back. I should have taken pictures as I had my camera on me and it would have been totally safe. I would also have coped better with the oppressive atmosphere if I had something to focus on. I was just so overwhelmed and irritated that I spaced. The bus ride out there was quite pretty though, especially <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=rio+de+janeiro,+brazil&ie=UTF8&ll=-23.009557,-43.291283&spn=0.020422,0.029182&t=k&z=15&om=1" target="_blank">this </a>strip of highway. Just stunning.

One shopping trip I did enjoy this week was going to get some swim wear with Fernanda, my Portuguese tutor. First [store][1] we went into, 20 minutes, well priced, easy!

Obviously I need to get myself into the sun! I match the closet!
