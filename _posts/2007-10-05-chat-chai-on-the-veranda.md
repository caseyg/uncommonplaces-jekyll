I went to the <a href="http://indiachina.newschool.edu/default.aspx" target="_blank">India China Institute</a>&#8216;s Chat & Chai get together today. The India China Institute (ICI) at The New School runs several fellowship programs and event series. They generously funded my trip to India in 2006. The next round of applications is due soon. They pushed the deadline back to October 30 as they are hoping to get more <a href="http://indiachina.newschool.edu/icifellows/student_howtoapply.aspx" target="_blank">student fellowship</a> applications from New School undergraduates. So if you are a student at the New School and want to go do research in India or China, go check out the links above. The &#8216;Chat & Chai&#8217; was nice as the food was great and the setting even better. ICI has the best realestate at the New School that I have seen.
