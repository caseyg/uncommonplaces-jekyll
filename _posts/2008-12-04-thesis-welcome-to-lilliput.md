I&#8217;ve been [stuck][1] with thesis for [Design and Technology][2].  I&#8217;m just about unstuck now&#8230;

My friend [Jeff Stark][3] does an event series called [“Where have you been?”][4] He was motivated to do the series because “New York has a way of swallowing homecomings. We are a notoriously self-interested city; circle the globe and your friends just tell you what you missed.”  So, in 2006, Jeff got a bunch of travelaholics together at [Bluestocking Bookstore][5] on the Lower East Side.  I was one of the guests at this inaugural event.  Jeff would interview each guest about their travels before a small audience.  In two years of running the event, Jeff has brought fun and surprising travel stories to intimate urban crowds.

I experienced the depressing reality of New York’s swallowing homecomings when I returned from extravagant world travels this summer.  I went to three continents, lived in the middle of an India political agitation, hand delivered postcards from one side of the globe to the other, danced salsa in an African capital, sang classic Bosa Nova tunes in a seedy pool hall at midnight, visited the Carmen Miranda museum… So many stories, and so much history in the places I went, so many complicated local contexts.

What do people ask for when I come back?  Photographs.  They want to see pictures.  I am disappointed.  Yes, sometimes I travel to take pictures, but not always, and this summer least of all.  Fine, photographs.  You want photographs.  But I won’t make it easy to look at them or make sense of them or let you think they are simply beautiful.

I ran into my friend [Edgar Mata][6] at a [gallery opening][7] recently.  After not seeing him for a good six months, I erupted with stories about what I did this summer, about disillusionment with school, about naïveté for the future.  “Wow, you sound like a world traveler,” he said in response to my lack of morning, understanding, or explicable direction.  This will be my starting point.

A classic travel story, Gulliver’s Travels, will set the stage and eschew any conceit about knowing where we are, geographically, intellectually, or personally.  This is a disorientation.

Welcome to Lilliput.
