I am very excited to congratulate my colleague Najlah Hicks and her organization [the Heart Gallery of New Jersey ][1]for winning the top prize in the 2008 [Russ Berrie Award ][2]for Making a Difference.  The $50,000 grant will help fund the operations of the Heart Gallery, which brings in world class photographers to make portraits of foster care youth in the effort to help them get adopted.  It has been a pleasure to [get to know ][3]Najlah and the Heart Gallery over the past year and I look forward to see them continue their work with the recognition and financial back needed to find loving homes for more foster care youth.  You can read the press release [here][4].
