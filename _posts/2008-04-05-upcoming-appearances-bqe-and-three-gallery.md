I have pieces in two upcoming shows.

Quito&#8217;s Thesis Show. Monday, April 7th, 8-9pm. Park Ave and Grand Ave, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.  
A stop motion piece I made in collaboration with [Joshua Blank][1] will be screened this coming Monday night under the BQE. The piece is about a journey to the Staten Island boat graveyard. The screening is part of [Quito Ziegler][2]&#8216;s thesis exhibition. She is finishing the [Bard-ICP MFA program][3]. She has aspirations to light up a large section of the dark area under the highway through a system powered by the traffic. This is an aesthetic test run and a number of fantastic shorts will be shown.

Idlewild, by [photoFeast][4]. Friday, April 18, 6-8pm. Three Gallery, Parsons School of Design, 66 Fifth Avenue, 3rd Floor.  
For the second consecutive year, I have a photograph in the Parsons Photography Department&#8217;s curated show of student work. The photo is from the [jazz funeral][5] I went to in New Orleans earlier this semester.
