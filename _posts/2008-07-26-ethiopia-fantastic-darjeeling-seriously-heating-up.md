I&#8217;m in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  There is lots of exciting work for me to do here.  More on that soon.

I just missed things really heating up in Darjeeling.  Yesterday, the homes of two top people of the political party formerly in power (GNLF) and a major restaurant in town were destroyed.  See more in [The Telegraph][1]&#8230; See my [summary post][2] for background info on the political situation there.
