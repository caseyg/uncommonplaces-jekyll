Thanks to a fast growing population, aggressive farming practices, and deforestation, over 70% of Ethiopia&#8217;s land is subject to [desertification][1], the deterioration of land due to loss of moisture and vegetation.  Reforestation is one way to combat this process.  On [International Volunteer Day][2], December 5th, volunteers in Debre Sina planted trees to commemorate the success of a local United Nations funded project to combat desertification.  &#8216;Involvement of Ethiopian Youth in Combating Desertification&#8217; has organized over 200 youth to plant trees on 438 hectares of land since 2006.
