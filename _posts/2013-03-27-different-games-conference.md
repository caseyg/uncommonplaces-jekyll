New York City is humming with opportunities to reflect on alternative, innovative game design. <a href="http://www.movingimage.us/films/2013/02/15/detail/indiecade-east/" target="_blank">IndieCade</a> happened for the first time on the east coast this winter thanks to the stewardship of <a href="http://madparker.com/" target="_blank">Matt Parker</a> in collaboration with the Museum of the Moving Image. Coming up on April 26th and 27th is the inaugural [Different Games Conference][1] hosted by NYU-Poly thanks to the hard work of <a href="http://www.differentgames.org/organizers/" target="_blank">Sarah Schoemann, Lain Nooney and Toni Pizza</a>.

Where IndieCade was an opportunity to play all sorts of games and hang out with the designers, Different Games will be a place to critically discuss who is represented in games, who makes games and how the community and industry can be more inclusive.

The <a href="http://www.differentgames.org/schedule/" target="_blank">full schedule has been announced</a>, with keynotes from <a href="http://www.maryflanagan.com/" target="_blank">Mary Flanagan</a> and <a href="http://cpandfriends.com/" target="_blank">Celia Pearce</a>. In addition to advising on the confrence, I&#8217;ll be doing a breakout session called &#8220;*Until the Revolution Comes: Navigating Sexism in the Industry&#8221; *and my collaborator at <a href="playistheantidote.com" target="_blank">Anitdote Games</a> Mohini Dutta will be presenting* &#8220;*Games Colonialism: Cultural Assumptions in Game Design&#8221; **which draws on our work making games for international contexts.

<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5479324808" target="_blank">Registration</a> is open. It&#8217;s free and likely to fill up. I look forward to seeing you there!
