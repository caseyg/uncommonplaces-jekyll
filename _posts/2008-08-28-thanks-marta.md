I want to send a shout out to Marta, my guide and translator in Addis Ababa.  She’s a member of [Sudden Flowers][1] and was tasked with my safety and contentment while in Ethiopia.  I was in good hands.  She was wonderful company and carried out my requests with zeal and determination.  I was often torn between getting work done and listening to Marta’s crafty story telling, or simply watching her brighten every random stranger’s day with charming conversation.  She taught me a great deal about Addis and has ensured that I will forever look fondly upon my time there.  Thanks Marta!
