  I&#8217;ve been producing online salons for the blog <a href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/">BAGnewsNotes</a>.  Academics, photographers, and blog readers get together to discuss visual politics.  At the next Salon scheduled for mid-January, we&#8217;ll be looking at the media&#8217;s portrayal of Michelle Obama.
