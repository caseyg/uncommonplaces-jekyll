The strike is off.  Information changes on a daily basis, if not more often.  Seems like lots of people are upset because they scrambled to stock up for 45 days, some even taking out loans, and now the party has opened everything back up.  I don’t understand their tactics.  Much of my information is coming via Sarah Besky, a PhD anthropology student who is working on plantation labor issues.  She has been in Darjeeling for a while and speaks wonderful Nepali.  We hung out yesterday at the student rally (they happen at least once a week).

Afterwards, in frustration over our respective canceled meetings, we went jewelry shopping.  There are still no tourists, so we were the only ones in the shops overstuffed with wares from Tibet, Nepal, and Kashmir.  We tried on everything.  It was great fun. The shops don’t allow photography, otherwise I would show you.

Check out the crossed kukuri earrings I got.  The crossed kukuris is one of the icons on the Gorkha flag.  I have a few actual kukuris back home from my precious trip.
