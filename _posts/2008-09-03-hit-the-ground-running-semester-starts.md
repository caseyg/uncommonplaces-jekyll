I got back to New York the night before classes started.  It&#8217;s not as crazy as it sounds.  I&#8217;m glad to fall right into a schedule after being self-directed all summer.  I&#8217;m starting my last year of the dual BA/BFA degree at [the New School][1].  My concentration at [Eugene Lang][2] is [History][3], and my concentration at [Parsons][4] is [Design + Technology][5].

What am I taking this semester?

**Cold War Media, Technology, and Culture** &#8211; This history course is taught by [Orit Halpern][6], who has a reputation at the New School for being a brilliant young star.  The course explores the sociocultural impact of technology emerging after WWII, with a focus on the changing relationship of bodies, machines, and minds.  I am thrilled to be addressing the themes I encounter in the Design+Technology from a historical context.

**Thesis 1** &#8211; We&#8217;ve been warned that the mid-semester presentation is the point of no return.  We&#8217;ve got to know what we are making and stick with it though to the senior show.  Full speed ahead!  [Dave Carroll][7], is a mainstay of the D+T department.  His specialty is mobile and interactive media.

**Intro to Databases: PHP and MySQL** &#8211; As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s pretty simple to learn the syntax of these languages.  The real challenge is in constructing efficient databases and systems for using them.  Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about that, we&#8217;ll see.  I&#8217;m kinda chomping at the bit to get back into code after a semester break.  The class is taught by [Jamie Kosoy][8], senior developer at [Big Space Ship][9].  To put it simply, he knows his stuff.

**Advanced Flash: Actionscripting** &#8211; If the databases class will teach me how to build the engine, this class will teach me how to paint and polish the body.  [Catherine Garnier][10] is the professor.  I hope my love for code won&#8217;t override my need to master the visual aspects of Flash.

**Digital Audio and Video** &#8211; Finally I will be working on some Final Cut Pro.  I worked with [Robert Millazzo][11], the class professor, last fall.  His 5 Obstructions class was a roller coaster.  I appreciate it in retrospect, so I&#8217;m back for more.

**Portuguese 3** &#8211; Because I can&#8217;t help myself.

I will also audit as many of [Julia Wargaski][12]&#8216;s classes as I can manage.  She teaches typography and information design.  Her style is fierce and guided by gut instinct.

Should I feel overwhelmed?  I&#8217;m just kinda totally excited.
