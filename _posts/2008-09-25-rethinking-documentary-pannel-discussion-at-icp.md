This past Saturday at ICP,  [Susan Meiselas][1], [David Levi Strauss][2], and Mary Panzer discussed [rethinking documentary][3].  Kristen Lubben moderated the discussion.  The central question was “How do you tell other people’s stories?”.

“Just because it’s problematic, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it,” asserted Strauss.  Meiselas noted that it’s about reciprocity of experience, which is a central theme throughout her work.  By focusing on the reciprocity in the process, the vital question of what is being reciprocated comes to the forefront and problematizes the act of representing someone else.  What is being represented exactly and for what aim?  Meiselas wants to go behind the photo to who made it and who is in it.  This impulse moves her to incorporate interviews and audio narratives in her work and at times branch out into video.

The panel circled around the issue of information overload propagated by the internet.  Panzer seemed particularly overwhelmed by this predicament.  “We are blinded by all of these pictures.  How are we going to sort it out?”  She brought a photography book printed in the 1930s (I believe..) called Eyes On The World where a glut of photographs overwhelmed the viewer.  She likened this time in photo editing and photo narratives to what we see on the internet now.  There is a euphoria of production without a coherence of intent.  She asked how is it that you communicate photography on the web.  I would argue that the questions broader.  How do we communicate on the web? Full stop.

Meiselas kept coming back to the tension between description and interpretation, as well as the confusing dilemma of creating spectacle rather than motivating engagement.  You need to entertain enough to retain attention, but when it comes to conscientious engagement, entertainment in and of itself is failure.

I was charmed by Meiselas’s interest in [6 Billion Others][4].  The website consists of video clips of people from all over the world talking about all sorts of things. Watching these, it&#8217;s difficult to feel like anyone really is an ‘other.’  “They don’t need any of us,” Meiselas said, &#8216;us&#8217; being the media makers.  The &#8216;other&#8217; can tell their own stories.

“I really want to know what people want to know.”  &#8211; Susan Meiselas
