Today through Sunday is the [Come Out & Play Festival][1].  The festival, now in its fourth year, provides a forum for new types of public games and play.  Traditional games happen on a grand scale, digital games make use of mobile devices to get people out into the city, and unconventional games rethink public space and play.

Over 40 people are registered for the game, which is scheduled for 4:30 on Saturday in DUMBO, Brooklyn.  Hope it doesn&#8217;t rain!
