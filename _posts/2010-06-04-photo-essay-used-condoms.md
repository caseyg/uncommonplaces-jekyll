I think I&#8217;m finished this photo essay on used condoms. Performing in the [Vagina Monologues][1] in Addis Ababa last month helped purge some of the frustrations that motivated the project.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1968" title="IMG_0233 copy" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images//2010/06/IMG_0233-copy.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="576" />][2]

> Sex work is prevalent and highly visible in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. So, it was not hard to guess why a quiet residential street near my home there was consistently littered with used condoms. At night, the dark, winding road offered a reasonably safe location for transactions. This doesn’t explain why I decided to photograph the condoms, though.

Read the rest of the artist statement and see the full set of photos on my [portfolio site][2].  If you have an idea for a better title of the essay, I&#8217;d love to hear your suggestions.  
*Update June 14, 2010*: Thanks [Jessica Berta][3] for title suggestions.
