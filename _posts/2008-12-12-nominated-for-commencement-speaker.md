Check out what just came over my email:

> Congratulations Ida!
> 
> I am happy to inform you that the Design and Technology program and the School of Art, Media & Technology have nominated you to be the commencement speaker at the 2009 graduation ceremony.

Awesome!  Thanks to my academic advisers and professors for nominating me.  I have to compose a speech abstract for the next phase of the selection process, which will happen in early March.
