I&#8217;ve had a few blows to my self-esteem and grounding over the past week. I&#8217;ve also experienced quite a number of successes and great gains. It&#8217;s been a struggle balancing the two sides, and right now the down side is weighing in heavier.

I have a great deal of free time at the moment because it&#8217;s the break between semesters and my travel plans fell through at the last minute. With this free time and the rocky emotions, I&#8217;m re-centering through meditation, exercising at capoeira classes and on bike rides, cleaning house literally by completely rearranging and reorganizing my apartment, and spending time with friends that I neglect when I am overrun with school work. (I&#8217;ve only made so much progress with my [reading list][1].)Â  All of this has been uplifting. I think meditation is the key piece. When I keep up with a daily practice, I am attuned. The mental chatter quiets down and undercurrents are more accessible. I follow my intuition. Intuition takes you to the places you need to go. Some of these places have been near agonizing recently. I take it as an indication that I am in transition, moving from one place to another. Old wounds get opened, retreated, and heal over a little better. It&#8217;s the perfect time for it to happen as I have the energy to attend to them. I go through this periodically and I&#8217;m always better for it.

&#8220;You know there&#8217;s the low tide moment when the water doesn&#8217;t even seem to be moving, we need to breath like that.&#8221;
