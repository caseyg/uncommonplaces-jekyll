The [BagNewsSalon][1], a program of [BagNewsNotes][2], brings together the world&#8217;s leading photojournalists, visual academics and other informed observers to understanding how the visual media frames the key social and political events of the day. I have had the pleasure of producing the online Salons for several years now. With new partnerships and technology platforms, the series has really taken off. Given the depth of insight produced during the 90-minute conversation, we&#8217;ve made a concerted effort to make archives of the salons available at the BagNews site.

Upon the death of Bin Laden, we looked at photographic coverage of both the compound where Bin Laden was killed and the reaction to the news globally. Images of screens, newspapers and people watching revealed how much the event was a global media phenomenon. [ [Archive of The Fall of Bin Laden Salon][3] ]

The Great Recession was a largely invisible event, so the salon discussion revolved around how it was rendered visual through depictions of loss, destitution and perseverance. [ [Archive of The Great Recession Salon][4] ]

For a Salon on Occupy Wall St, we drew from a broad range of sources to look at how image making and circulation became central to the most successful social movement in the United States in recent memory. [ [Archive of the Occupy Wall Street Salon][5] ]

For the upcoming Salon on the Presidential Campaign, the panel will discuss what photos imply about the campaign, as well as the depth, breadth and nature of the mediaâ€™s visual coverage. I hope you can [join us on January 29th][6].
