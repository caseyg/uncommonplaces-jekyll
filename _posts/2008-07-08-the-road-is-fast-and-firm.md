My stomach turned when I happen upon this sight: one of the milk trucks had fallen off the road.  It was upside down before I took the picture.  They managed to turn it over and later get it back on the road.  Apparently no one was hurt.  The road in the community is ridiculously steep and winding.  It is corroding under the pressure of small landslides.  Every time I go in and out of the community, there are points where I silently chant to myself, “The road is fast and firm.  The road is fast and firm.”  I’ll just keep telling myself that&#8230;
