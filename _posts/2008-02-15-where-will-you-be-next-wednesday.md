I&#8217;ll be a guest speaker on Jeff Stark&#8217;s series [&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;][1], along with my colleague Tim Kantz. We&#8217;ll be at [Bluestockings Bookstore][2] on Wednesday, February 20th at 7pm. I was a guest at the inaugural &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; almost a year and a half ago.  The series of monthly interviews on travel has grown into a lively, unexpected, and inevitably satisfying event.  I&#8217;m stoked to be back now that the event has grown in momentum and become on of Bluestocking&#8217;s most consistently well attended and anticipated regular event.

> Where Have You Been?
> 
> Stories about travel and far-away places. New Yorkers go all over the  
> world but the city has a way of swallowing their homecomings. Orbit  
> the earth and your friends just ask if you missed the pizza. This  
> homespun live talk show offers a chance for travelers to tell  
> stories, to bring the world home and share it with the rest of us —  
> travelers as well as those of us who don’t get out much.
> 
> Tonight features interviews with three intrepids: Jef Wolfy Scharf  
> investigates the toilets of Europe, Ida Benedetto and Tim Kantz team  
> up with fair trade coffee farmers in Western Guatemala, and Anastasia  
> Andino palled around Thailand with a monkey. Bonus: slides from a  
> pauper’s cemetery in New Orleans.
> 
> Interviews by Jeff Stark. Gorgeous slideshows tightly edited and  
> mercifully short.
