This is the patio of the apartment I&#8217;ve been staying at here in Rio.  It&#8217;s been great having this as a home base for my time here.

I had a hard time in Rio last summer, especially after getting jumped pretty badly on the beach a few days into the trip.  The city hums with a tension that I had never felt before.  I wondered if this is what New York felt like in the 1980&#8242;s.  This trip, I knew what to expect and landed with a cadre of friends to hang out with.  I feel like a bit of a liability for them when we&#8217;re out late.  &#8220;So, how do we get the gringa home?&#8221;  Drunk driving is prevalent, even among cab drivers, and the subways close at midnight.  My red hair has me pegged as a foreigner and attracts attention.  Inevitably, when we are out, a stranger will look at me with barely veiled enthusiasm and ask a Brazilian in our group, &#8220;De onde é?&#8221; (Where&#8217;s she from?).  Usually, they are looking for an excuse to break out their English and gush about how much they love the US, or specifically New York City.  My friends have taken to kidding me for my &#8220;interesting factor.&#8221;

So, a rumble of tention and the possibility of violence mixed with perpetual invites for conversation.  It sucked the first time I was here.  Now I&#8217;ve learned to go with it and trust my local friends to watch out for me.  Come Monday, I&#8217;ll be off to New York where I am no longer so interesting and I certainly can&#8217;t dance as well.  It will be a relief and a let down, as going home always is.
