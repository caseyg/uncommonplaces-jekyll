On Thursday, I headed down to SVS with three people from DLR Prerna, the local NGO that is helping me out, to start distributing the postcard booklets.  The board of directors suggested we meet in the office at 1pm.  I was skeptical that people would show.  Thursday, the strike was let up in anticipation of the district going on strike again today, Saturday. People went to town to buy supplies while they could. No one who was supposed to come to the meeting was actually available. Planning has become exceedingly difficult because the political situation shifts on a daily basis.  I myself went frantically shopping the morning before the meeting, along with most of the rest of Darjeeling.  We did set up in the office and invited those who happened to be around.  We gave representatives from each hamlet a stack of booklets and their choice of postcards.

A little over half the hamlets should be getting booklets.  We’ll do another round soon to make sure the rest of the hamlets are covered and as many households as possible get copies.  I shot some video of the process. There are some technical complications with the camera I have, so I probably cant’ post any video until after I get back to NYC in September.  Tomorrow is the annual general meeting, so I’ll go to that and see if I can get some light side conversation about the project going.  The farmers were generally curious and enthusiastic.  Nothing is going as planned, and everything is going well.
