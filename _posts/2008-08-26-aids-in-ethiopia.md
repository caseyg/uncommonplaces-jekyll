Here starts my Ethiopia report back.  I was in the capital of Addis Ababa from July 23rd through August 12th.  Ethiopia’s the first place I’ve been where my hotel room had condoms supplied.  (No, it was not that kind of hotel.)    [UNAIDS estimates][2] that between 420 and 1,300 thousand people are living with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia.  Of these people only about 7% are receiving antiretroviral treatment.  [UNICEF][3] puts the percentage of children in Ethiopia living without one or both parents at 13%, with a notable number of these kids loosing their parents to AIDS.  [Sudden Flowers][4], the organization I went to visit, is a collaborative of HIV/AIDS orphans that benefited from the programs of [Hope For Children][5], a charity organization that works with some 800 orphans in Addis Ababa.  The effort to popularize condom use in the capital was evident in the availability of free condoms and the prevalence of ad campaigns.  The continued resistance to adopting such forms of prevention is often seen as being cultural.  Same seems to go for practices such as female genital mutilation.

I base these statements on anecdotal conversations I had throughout the trip.  I want to do more research on the matter because it pertains to the opportunities to do creative media work around shifting these cultural practices.
