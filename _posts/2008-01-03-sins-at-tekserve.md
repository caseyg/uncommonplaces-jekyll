When there are a lot of people waiting around looking to get their computers fixed, staff open the machine up and distribute Coke. Something seems terribly wrong about this, even if it is free, from a vintage machine, and in a cute little bottle. I confess my sins.

(The optical drive on my computer is busted&#8230; this is after picking is up for other repairs a few days ago.)
