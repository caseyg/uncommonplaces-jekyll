I am going to Guatemala tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be back in NYC on the 26th. My friend Tim of [Cafe Conciencia][1] hired a design collective, [The Change][2], to redesign the coffee packaging of the four communities they work with, as well as redo the webpage. I&#8217;ll be taking portraits of the farmers for the next week for the new design. Yay, Guatemala!
