A surge of student organizing this semester at the New School includes two fledgling community media projects spreading their wings.  This Thursday night, the New School radio station [WSNR][1] and web publishing portal [The New Campus][2] will host [Bite Your Tongue][3], a night of media, art, and socializing in the Teresa Lang Center at 55 W 13th st.  The stop motion adventure [The Ferry Boats][4], which I produced with [Joshua Blank][5], will be screened in addition to other top-notch, hand-picked pieces.  Come see!
