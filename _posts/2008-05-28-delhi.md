The flight from New York was easy. I slept most of the way. I got to Delhi and took a cab to a friend&#8217;s place in Defense Colony. My plan was to leave this morning for Darjeeling. Some friendly face, Scottish whiskey, and a dependable offer to drive me to the airline&#8217;s office in the morning to change my flight (fee of only $15) is enough to have me here until <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Sunday</span> next Friday. I can feel New York&#8217;s pace slogging off of me as summer starts in earnest.
