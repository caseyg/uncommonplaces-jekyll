What better theme for a game jam than Jean Claude Van Damme? This jam concept was inspired by Kaho Abe&#8217;s Indie Tech talk. A joke about a &#8220;Jean Claude Van Jam&#8221; came up after her talk, I registred the URL and things just went from there. This weekend, 60 artists, programmers, musicians, street performers, and post-apocalyptic survivalists will work furiously for 48 hours to make games inspired by the expansive filmography of Jean Claude Van Damme. The jam is a collaboration between Baybcastles and the Eyebeam Game Design Research Group. Get all the info here: [http://www.jeanclaudevanjam.com][1].
