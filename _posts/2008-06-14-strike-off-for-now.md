The strike let up on Thursday and Friday in anticipation of going back on strike starting today, Saturday.  They have pushed the strike back again until Monday though.  The situation changes on a daily basis.  I have moved into a room with a small stove and bought plenty of supplies, so if things do shut down for a while, I should have no problem.  The markets were total chaos these past two days.  I don’t have any pictures of that because I was too busy being part of it.

On Thursday evening, there was a vigil and rally in response to the death of two Nepalese people in Siliguri, the big town in the planes region just on the edge of Darjeeling.  The deaths were a result of ethnic violence sparked in response to the agitation for Gorkhaland statehood.  Right now, the political party in Darjeeling wants Siliguri to be part of the new state.  The Bengalis in Siliguri aren’t into that idea.  2,000 to 2,500 people attended the vigil in Darjeeling town center.  The rally was peaceful and vibrant.  I got an impression of hope and resolve.  A friend later summarized the speeches as moving back toward Gandhian methods, which is a shift from a more aggressive stance a few weeks ago.

Yesterday, I came across the school kids gathered in the same town square listening to a speech.  School will be in session through any strike.
