> I used to be one of those people who believed that someone would never confess to something they didn&#8217;t do. Society as a whole believes that. And yet here I am. There&#8217;s a false confession out there that I gave for a murder that someone else committed. Until you go through it, you just won&#8217;t know how much of an interrogation you can take.

From the YouTube video description:  
Damon Thibodeaux spent 15 years on death row for a crime he did not commit. He was questioned in 1996 after the disappearance of his cousin, and after 36 hours with no sleep and a 9-hour interrogation, Damon falsely confessed to the crime. After 15 years on Louisiana&#8217;s death row, Damon was proved innocent by DNA evidence.

Antidote is in the final stages of making a game about this topic for <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank">The Innocence Project</a>. It&#8217;s going very well so far. Can&#8217;t wait to share it more widely. We&#8217;re playing it at the <a href="http://www.differentgames.org/" target="_blank">Different Games Conference</a> right now.
