I am in Darjeeling, arrived two days ago.  The fog and the steep slopes and the frenetic but small-town pace are a welcome change from Delhi.  The NGO I am working with is enthusiastic about the project, and I&#8217;m looking forward to hitting the ground in the next few says to start engaging with the community.  Right now, everyone is busy with World Environment Day, which stretches into a week of activities here.  Darjeeling even banned plastic bags recently.  Awesome!

More soon!
