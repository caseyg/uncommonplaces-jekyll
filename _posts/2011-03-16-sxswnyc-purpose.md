Some of the fine folks at [Purpose][1], an agency that builds 21st century movements, decided to do something about their angst over not making it to Austin for SXSW Interactive. They put together an [alternative SXSW NYC][2] at their offices last Friday. I had the opportunity to present a snappy, 5-minute talk on insights I developed working with [Sudden Flowers Productions][3] in Ethiopia.
