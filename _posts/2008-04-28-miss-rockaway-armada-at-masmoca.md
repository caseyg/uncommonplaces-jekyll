Some of my brilliant anarchist artsy friends made a boat out of scrap materials, float down the Mississippi River in it every summer, and do performances in towns along the way. The established art world has decided that they want in on this, so the [Miss Rockaway Armada][1] was invited to [build an installation][2] at [Mass MoCA][3]. The installation is on view until March 2009.
