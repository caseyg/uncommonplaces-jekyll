Space Cruiser is a cooperative mission-based game centered around navigating around a fictional universe, designed for 100-200 participants to be installed at Hayden Planetarium of the Museum of Natural History for night on January 26th, 2012. The game is being put on by [Babycastles][1], designed by [Ivan Safrin][2].

I made this trailer from my footage of the amazing playtest last night.

The game imagines the planetarium as a large, player-controllable spacecraft. A multi-player control deck at the center of the theater will offer a small crew the chance to navigate the spacecraft together, piloting through treacherous asteroid belts. The crew is an unassigned, free-form team that works together to pilot the spaceship, with various parts of the ship spread out over the theater while being guided by a on-board computer system that is voiced by Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields. For the one time event, Greg Fox will play a live sound track. All space ship modules have been hand made by Mike Anderson.
