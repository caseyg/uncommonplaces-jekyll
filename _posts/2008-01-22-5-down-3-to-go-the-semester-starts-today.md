<img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/cables.jpg" alt="power strip daisy chain" align="right" width="300" />The spring semester starts today. I am pretty excited. All the down time this past month has given me ample oppertunity to recharge my batteries and pick up what will hopefully become good habits. Usually, I dash off to exotic locations to do sexy media and human rights work over the school breaks. Not this time. I&#8217;m starting to get restless already!

Here&#8217;s what we have up this semester:

**The History of Race and Slavery in Latin America**  
taught by [Robin Blackburn][1]  
There is a wikipedia article on him!

**Senior Thesis for History**  
adviser, [Paul Ross][2] (loving his profile picture here)  
I&#8217;m not in my last year of undergrad yet, but I can stager the senior theses so as not to be crazed with both Design and Technology and History work.

**Core 6: Prototyping**  
taught by [Rees Shad][3]  
This is the main requirement for [Design and Technology][4]. What I hear is that this class is test run for thesis. We pitch and execute a project that will inform senior work.

**Architecture and Social Practice**  
taught by [Brian McGrath][5], [Vyjayanthi Rao][6], and [Jane Pirone][7].  
I still don&#8217;t really understand what this course is going to cover, but all the professors rock.

**Aesthetics in Early Film**  
taught by [Heliodoro San Miguel][8]  
This is to fill an art history requirement.

**Portuguese 2**  
taught by Tobias Nascimento (no link!)  
Because I think I did end up leaving half my heart in Brazil, and my history adviser seems to think my Spanish is pretty good already.

The other big school related project is student government. [The New School][9] held it&#8217;s first elections for student government ever at the end of last semester. I am representing [Parsons][10] along with two other students at the new University Student Senate. We have a lot of work cut out for us if we are going to make this a viable, robust, and effective body. It&#8217;s about time, so we&#8217;re going to make it happen.
