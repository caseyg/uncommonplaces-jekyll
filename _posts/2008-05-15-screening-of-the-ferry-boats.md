<img class="alignleft" style="float:left;" src="http://cdt.parsons.edu/files/images/Film%20Festival3_small.preview.jpg" alt="annimation festival flyer" align="left" /> The stop motion piece [The Ferry Boats][1] that I created with Joshua Blank will be screened as part of the Parsons Annimation Film Festival.

The show is tomorrow night, Friday, May 16th. 6pm in the Swayduck Auditorum, 65 5th ave between 13th and 14th streets. Free.

Come see motion graphics and live action shorts made by the rapaciously creative and technically dexterous. You will not be disapointed.
