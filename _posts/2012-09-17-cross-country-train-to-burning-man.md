Traveling long distances by land sometimes feels like a lost art. I relish it, and I don&#8217;t even have a driver&#8217;s license. This year, I took an Amtrak train from New York City to Winnemucca, Nevada to attend Burning Man for the first time. I got to unwind from a busy work schedule before hitting the Playa, hang out with other burners &#8211; more than I anticipated &#8211; who were also taking the train, and see the country by land for the first time in 5 or 6 years. Here are some photos I took along the way.
