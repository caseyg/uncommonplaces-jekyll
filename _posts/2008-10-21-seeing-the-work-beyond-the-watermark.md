I’ve been thinking about an anecdote from kindergarten:

The class was given sheets of paper with homework printed on them.  I can’t remember what the homework activity was.  I was way more interested in the watermark on the paper.  I went home and rubbed my crayons over the watermark to make the details of it visible.  The teacher didn’t like my crayon rubbings revealing the watermark.  Her agenda was to get me to do the assignment.  She sent me home the next day with a new piece of paper with the homework printed on it.  I came back with the same results.  “Look!  There’s a watermark!  Can’t  you see it!  How cool.”  The physical reality of the paper continued to mean more to me than the symbols printed on it.

We went through this about 5 times until my mom got involved.  I don’t know if the teacher sent a note home or something, but it became clear that I was not going to follow instructions if left to my own devices.  An intervention was necessary.  I sat at the kitchen table with mom hovering over me.  She walked me through, step-by-step, the instructions of the exercises and the actions that each logical interpretation of the instructions necessitated.  I remember her deliberate, edgy tone as she forced herself to be patent in the effort to move me toward completing my homework.  I completed each step with deep skepticism.  At that age, as a compulsively imaginative introvert, the vexing of my teacher didn’t faze me and thus did not influence my decision to freely interpret the possibilities I saw in my homework.  Only upon my mother’s intervention where I was given no option for interpretation that deviated from completing the task did I do what was expected of me.

I&#8217;m still disappointed that no one else was interested in the watermark.
