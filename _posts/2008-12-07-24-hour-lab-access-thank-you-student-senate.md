Here is a screen shot of the New School webpage displaying lab house this coming week:

That&#8217;s right!  The New School is finally keeping the main computer labs open 24-hours during finals.  Students and faculty have been struggling for this as long as I&#8217;ve been at The New School.  The common higher education practice of maintaining around-the-clock access to facilities during peek study times in the semester had not been implemented here because the administration alternately didn&#8217;t think the students would use the lab space/didn&#8217;t want to pay the extra staffing hours.  Last semester, the University Student Senate, largely following Hendrick Cho&#8217;s initiative, convinced the administration to keep the main floor lounge in the 55  W 13th St building open 24 hours throughout finals week.  This semester, continued pressure from students compounded with closures of major sections of the university for building construction (which won&#8217;t happen in the foreseeable future given the number of New School investors also involved in Lieberman Brothers), has motivated the administration to keep the computer labs themselves open.  Finally!  I am reasonably on top of my work and hope not to be pulling all nighters in the computer lab, but it&#8217;s a huge relief to know that it&#8217;s there if I need it.  Hope this makes everyone&#8217;s finals weeks a little easier!
