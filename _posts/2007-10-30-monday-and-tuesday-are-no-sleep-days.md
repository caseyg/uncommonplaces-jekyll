John Ross as an [article on Counter Punch][1] about Brad Will. The memorial on Saturday was intimate and reflective (see [previous entry][2]). Brad was such a clown, so up beat, that it&#8217;s a pleasure to remember him. Now we just need some justice. I haven&#8217;t had time to edit my photos or audio from the event. Will do soon.

I also made it to Bike Kill on Saturday. Bike Kill is an annual event put on the by [Black Label][3] bicycle gang where crowds gather in an alley in Brooklyn to smash around home made bike creations. Again, pictures forthcoming. Going to stuff like this make me miss the days when I wasn&#8217;t in school and had time to do things for fun. Oh, the self-pity. <img src="http://uncommonplaces.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

Today I presented a short paper on the [LOLcat Bible Translation Project][4] in the context of [Manovich][5]&#8216;s principles of new media. I just love what flies at Parsons. Check out [my paper][6].
