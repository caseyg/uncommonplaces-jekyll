In a [previous entry][1], I complained about my frustrations with learning Flash. I am more or less keeping up. I was surprised to get a good grade for the midterm evaluation. I still feel frustrated and bored out of m mind. Why was I so much more entertained by [Processing][2]?

lovely. I need to figure out how to entertain myself with flash. I know it&#8217;s an important skill set and that I will regret not knowing it better later. I am running into similar difficulties with my Interaction class, which is largely flash based. I spent some 45 hours on my midterm project, with no so interesting results. Exhausting.

I am only in one production class next semester.  My intention is to use what I learn this semester and over bootcamp in my seminar classes.  The content of my classes will be engaging and intellectually stimulating, giving me the creative fuel to use some of the dry tech skills I am begrudgingly learning.
