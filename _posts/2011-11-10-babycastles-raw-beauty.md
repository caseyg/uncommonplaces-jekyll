Between making the [Games For Change Festival][1] happen in June and [subsequent international adventures][2], my blog fell by the wayside. I&#8217;ve got a list of at least 15 possible posts to write. Daunting! So let&#8217;s get started the easy way and post some video. 

Here is raw footage I shot at two recent [Babycastles][3] events. Babycastles is an independent videogame arcade production group and general pervayor of independent game culture. As the Babycastles Archivist and Documentarian, capturing video of events is only a small part of my responsibilities, but it&#8217;s definitely the most fun part. Babycastles enthusiasts far and wide are enjoying the unedited takes of events.  


#### **QWOP THE SCREEN â‹° Highly Physical Videogames**

A collection of highly physical videogame installations. Games that deliberately make it awkward to see the screen, as well as games that get rid of screens entirely. This was the funnest Babycastles opening I remember. Curated by Doug Wilson, Bennett Foddy, and Matt Parker. October 7th, 2011 at 285 Kent Ave.

#### **BABYCASTLES 285 KENT CLOSING PARTY**

The party celebrates the the arcade&#8217;s six-month run in Williamsburg on November 4, 2011. Babycastles is not over. It&#8217;s just transforming. The night featured performances by Inspectah Deck and Colt Seavers of the Wu Tang Clan, Ava Luna and DJ Dog Dick. A tournament of J.S. Joust was played. The winner took home a copy of Katamari Damacy signed by Keita Takahashi. Games produced by the Parsons/Babycastles Game Jam were available to play. Minorities could sign up as bone marrow donors as part of the &#8220;Amit Gupta Needs You&#8221; campaign.
