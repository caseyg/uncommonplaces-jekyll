For my 5 Obstructions Digital Video class, we have to produce 5 short films following obstructions that the professor <a href="http://www.parsons.edu/faculty_and_staff/faculty_details.aspx?dID=69&sdID=91&pType=2&id=4515" target="_blank">Robert Milazzo</a> gives us. The exercise is based on a challenge that [Lars Von Trier][1] gave to [Jørgen Leth][2] to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Obstructions" target="_blank">remake</a> his short film <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8341864322805018162&q=The+Perfect+Human&total=1111&start=0&num=10&so=0&type=search&plindex=1" target="_blank">The Perfect Human</a>.

I shot my second video last night with my faithful crew, <a href="http://www.andrealira.com/" target="_blank">Andrea Lira</a>. The obstructions involved remaking another student&#8217;s first obstruction film. We could only shoot outdoors, no hand held camera shots. The short has to be 4 minutes long exactly, include 2 night shots, and have the words from the line &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to use your eyes, son,&#8221; but broken up into several different lines. I am really enjoying this class, as frustrating as it might sound. Given parameters that I am inclined to respect, even if they are arbitrary, I feel comfortable and confident. The classes I am having trouble in are the ones where I don&#8217;t understand the instructions, or where the instructions are vague. I think the first the video I made for my first obstruction a few weeks ago was a success. I would post it if I could figure out how to compress it properly. It&#8217;s over a gigabyte right now.

This time around, I filmed <a href="http://endlesssummerpress.com/Josh_Blank/joshblankhome.html" target="_blank">Joshua Blank</a> painting on his roof. To reciprocate, I sat for a portrait. Josh studies photography at Parsons. He also got Andrea to sit for a portrait. Here&#8217;s my pictures from the adventure with the view camera.
