> &#8220;Wrongful convictions represent a complete failure, if not breakdown, in the procedural safeguards and discretionary decisions making of the criminal justice system. There is no outcome that the system is, in theory, more structured to avoid. It can only occur if there are multiple and conjectural errors by numerous criminal justice officials and triers of fact who, at every stage of the criminal process, fail to identify, understand, and reverse the errors that occurred in the earlier stages.&#8221;
