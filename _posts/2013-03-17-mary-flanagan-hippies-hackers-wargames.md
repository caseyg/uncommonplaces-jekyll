She looked back at the history of computing and games as a history of outsiders and aesthetics, rather than a narrative of war and competition that is often offered up. Mary Flanagan is a professor of Digital Humanities at Dartmouth and director of <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/" target="_blank">Tiltfactor</a>, a game design and research lab for social impact games.

Flanagan started by appealing to a common sentiment in the audience. &#8220;I suspect this room is filled with idealists. We as a group really want to understand what these digital games are.&#8221; She asserted that the history of computing is driven by people and, like the game designers in attendance, these people were idealists and often introspective personalities with uncomfortable relationships with the rest of society. She introduced (or re-introduced) us to 7 influential figures.

(Note: Images in this post are my own additions and not necessarily the visuals Flanagan used in her original presentation.)

### 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard" target="_blank">Jacquard (Joseph-Marie Charles)</a>

Jacquard ran failed business after failed business and then joined the French Revolution. He had a sordid past. His great contribution was a minor innovation to an existing loom. He was frequently attacked in the street for destroying jobs. His innovation is really about aesthetics, variety and complexity of fabric patterns.

### 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Augusta Ada Lovelace</a>

Illegitimate daughter of poet Lord Byron &#8220;who had lots of issues&#8221; and collaborator with the maverick Charles Babbage &#8220;who was known for never finish anything&#8221;. Ada helped invent the Analytical Engine. She is the first person to think about the computer as valuable beyond mathematics and computation. She saw computers as symbol machines that could create numerical representation of the world. The Analytical Engine was about the manipulation of symbols. Flanagan points out that games are no stranger to managing abstraction and symbols, too.

> &#8220;It might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine. Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.&#8221; &#8211; Ada Lovelace

### 3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2952" alt="Turing_Test_version_3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/Turing_Test_version_3-234x300.png" width="234" height="300" />Government code breaker, well known in WWII. While he worked as a code breaker, he was really interested in computing, machinery and intelligence, &#8220;something we&#8217;re still trying to sort out 50 years later.&#8221; His contribution was really a game, an imitation game known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing Test</a>.

How was Turing a misfit to society? He died from cyanide poisoning under unclear and heavily disputed circumstances. His life before that was decidedly rough. He was arrested for having a male lover and underwent female hormone treatment rather than imprisonment. British government is still ashamed of how they treated him.

#### 4. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey" target="_blank">Christopher Strachey</a>

Computer scientist who wrote digital poetry. Can a computer be a tool of expression? He was also gay, suffered from social ostracism. Most of Flanagan&#8217;s time discussing Strachey consisted simply of sharing his poetry.  
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2954" alt="muc" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/muc-300x188.gif" width="300" height="188" />

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2955" alt="url" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/url.jpeg" width="803" height="245" />

### 5. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell" target="_blank">Steve Russell</a>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2958" alt="Spacewar-wikipedia" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/Spacewar-wikipedia-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" />Programmed the first video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!" target="_blank">Spacewar!</a>. He also did theater and continued to practice theater throughout his time working in computing. He never left the arts.

### 6. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_DeKoven" target="_blank">Bernie DeKoven</a>

DeKoven created the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/New_Games_movement" target="_blank">New Games Movement</a>. He believes that safety and failure are as important as success. Playing together means creating a relationship, games are not just about antagonism and competition. &#8220;Congress could seriously use an earth ball.&#8221;  
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2963" alt="Earth_Ball_3_medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/Earth_Ball_3_medium-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />

In analyzing DeKoven&#8217;s work, Flanagan pointed out that there is an edge to such togetherness, which is why cooperative activities used by the New Games movement are also seen in military training. By moving in unison, people are much more likely to obey even if they may disagree.

### 7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax" target="_blank">Gary Gygax</a>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2966" alt="4891410215_f2a842dea7_z" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/4891410215_f2a842dea7_z-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" />Gygax was a high school dropout. He invented the Dungeons & Dragons game system. His worked offered a sense of escapist empowerment. D&D is a mini operating systems for people to design games and story experiences. Flanagan points out that when we look back at the original marketing for games like Dungons & Dragons in the 70s, they were promoted as family games, not gendered experiences. Our current assumptions that these were boys games is anachronistic.

### Q & A

Much of the Q&A session, which included a conversation between Mary Flanagan and Game Center director Frank Lantz , analyzed our faulty assumptions of what games can and can&#8217;t do, especially in relation to the Games For Change and Serious Games movements. Here are a few notes I have on topics that came up:

Do games foster systems literacy? Lantz recounted an earlier observation from Flanagan that most people she knows in the games industry are libertarians. Does that point to a contradiction in what we think games literacy accomplishes? Maybe it creates an awkward literalness rather than a sophistication about real world systems? (My recounting of this particular exchange is fragmented. I include it here because it might be worth unpacking.)

Different cognitive styles should be encouraged and systems thinking is only one cognitive style. Here, Flanagan references the work of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Create-Your-Own-Economy-Prosperity/dp/0525951237/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a>. Lantz in his usual styles come up with some sticky mental image for this involving game designers have a bias toward the cognitive style that likes to disassemble toasters. Contrary to popular belief, an analytical cognitive style can lead to as rich a life as a charismatic style. (There seemed to be a toaster disassembler bias in the room.)

As for games and narrative, the more fantastic the context, the more open you are to learning. You are more empathetic to the thing that is far away. &#8220;Far mode&#8221; engages with grand values. &#8220;Close mode&#8221; just brings up all the pragmatic defenses and coping mechanisms you use to get through an average day of your life. Flanagan has done a rigerous scientific study on three versions of Tiltfactors&#8217; game <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/pox" target="_blank">Pox</a>, which is designed to convey how disease spreads. The zombie themed version outperforms the non-zombie version which outperforms the iPad version. (Apparently this is all just feminist standpoint theory, so we should go look that up. Flanagan dropped that bomb kinda late in the talk and didn&#8217;t go into it in detail.)

If our assumptions are wrong about what games can do and how they influence us, how do we do these studies that reveal what&#8217;s actually happening? Flanagan says, &#8220;I do studies because I fundraise.&#8221;

Lantz asked if his home institution of NYU has a psychology department. In considering doing psychological experiments on games, he adds &#8220;I&#8217;m picturing a 60&#8242;s approach where you party with the psychologists and drop acid with with the psychologists.&#8221;

(I&#8217;m not sure where that leaves the rest of us who do not have big institutions or droves of eager graduate students at our disposal or who are just over of hanging out with people on acid trips. I guess we just have to read the research. Luckily, Flanagan is coming out with <a href="http://www.maryflanagan.com/writing" target="_blank">a book on this topic called Values At Play</a> due out from MIT Press in 2014. She also recommends the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Redirect-Surprising-Science-Psychological-Change/dp/0316051888/" target="_blank">Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change</a> by Tim Wilson.)
