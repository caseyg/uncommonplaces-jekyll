At [PETLab][1], a social impact games research and development group at Parsons, the main project we&#8217;ve been working on over the past year is a game design curriculum called Activate!. Activate! uses both physical and digital activities to teach systems thinking, game design and issue literacy to middle school students. Last summer, we took Activate! to Abu Dhabi as part of the &#8220;Summer of Semiconductors&#8221; Program sponsored by the AMD Foundation and the Abu Dhabi Education Council. Our work with Activate! will be featured at the upcoming Game Developers Conference as part of [Games for Change&#8217;s day of programming][2]. Here&#8217;s the video I made about the program in Abu Dhabi:

This coming summer, Activate! will return to Dandelion Middle School in Beijing where it was first taught in 2010.
