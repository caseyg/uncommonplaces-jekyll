The Game Innovation Lab at NYU-Poly wanted to bring the vibrant New York games community to their space to benefit current students. 

I designed and kicked off a series of 10 talks for the 2012-2013 academic year in collaboration with indie arcade collective Babycastles. The series focuses on indie games and development. Speakers have included Kaho Abe, Scott Anderson, Kevin Cancienne, Ivan Safrin and Cindy Poremba. The series is hosted by Andy Nealen.
