PubIt! is Barnes & Nobleâ€™s platform for publishers and authors to digitally distribute their works through BN.com and the Barnes & Noble eBookstore. I was contracted in the early stages of PubIt!'s launch to build a Facebook page where authors could share knowledge and stay abreast of the rapidly evolving world of self-publishing. 

The engagement strategy, content guidelines and publication schedule I developed fostered a vibrant community PubIt! self-publisherswithin a month of going live. The page sustained engagement rates 5 times higher than the average page on Facebook.
