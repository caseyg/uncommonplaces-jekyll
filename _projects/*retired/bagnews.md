The BagNews Salons are a program of the political blog <a href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/salon/" target="_blank">BagNewsNotes</a>. The online events brought together photojournalists, visual academics and informed observers to analyze photojournalism and visual politics in the news cycle. I produced 14 online salons for BagNews between 2008 and 2012, ushering the series through a variety of conversations formats and technology platforms to foster robust discussion among panelists and fluid audience participation.

Salons have looked at the viral Kony 2012 video, the GOP 2012 primary campaign, Occupy Wall Street, the economic recession, the death of bin Laden, and the Egypt uprising. 

Participants have included heavy weights in photography and visual rhetoric such as David Campbell, Paul Lowe, Michelle Woodward, John Moore, Gerald Herbert, Jon Levy, Kari Goodnough, Fred Ritchen, Chris Hondros, Willie Davis, Tim Fadek, Alan Chin, John Lucaites, Robert Hariman, Daryl Lang, Mario Tama, Scout Tufankjian, Nina Berman and Catherine Squires.
