In July 2011, a team of American game experts taught 80 high school youth in Abu Dhabi how to design games. 

We used a curriculum called Activate! developed by PETLab at Parsons the New School for Design that I helped develop. In Abu Dhabi, I shot video to document the project and produced this short piece.
