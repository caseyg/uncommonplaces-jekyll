Film production studio Gravity Sleeps had a website built on an unwieldy content management system with a design that failed to let their work shine.

I reorganized and redesigned the site to be driven by their visually gripping work while clearly presenting their rental equipment offerings. Then, I built a Wordpress theme from scratch that focused on ease of use so that maintaining the site would be a joy.
